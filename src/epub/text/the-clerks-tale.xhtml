					<span>“Sir Clerk of Oxenford,” our Hostë said,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Ye ride as still and coy, as doth a maid</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That were new spoused, sitting at the board:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This day I heard not of your tongue a word.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I trow ye study about some sophime:<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2423" id="noteref-2423" epub:type="noteref">2423</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>But Solomon saith, every thing hath time.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For Goddë’s sake, be of better cheer,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2424" id="noteref-2424" epub:type="noteref">2424</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>It is no timë for to study here.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Tell us some merry talë, by your fay;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2425" id="noteref-2425" epub:type="noteref">2425</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>For what man that is entered in a play,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He needës must unto that play assent.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But preachë not, as friars do in Lent,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To make us for our oldë sinnës weep,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Nor that thy talë make us not to sleep.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Tell us some merry thing of áventures.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Your terms, your colourës, and your figúres,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Keep them in store, till so be ye indite</span>
					<br/>
					<span>High style, as when that men to kingës write.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Speakë so plain at this time, I you pray,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That we may understandë what ye say.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>This worthy Clerk benignëly answér’d;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Hostë,” quoth he, “I am under your yerd,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2426" id="noteref-2426" epub:type="noteref">2426</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Ye have of us as now the governánce,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And therefore would I do you obeisánce,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As far as reason asketh, hardily:<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2427" id="noteref-2427" epub:type="noteref">2427</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>I will you tell a talë, which that I</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Learn’d at Padova of a worthy clerk,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As proved by his wordës and his werk.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He is now dead, and nailed in his chest,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I pray to God to give his soul good rest.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Francis Petrarc’, the laureate poét,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2428" id="noteref-2428" epub:type="noteref">2428</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Hightë<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2429" id="noteref-2429" epub:type="noteref">2429</a> this clerk, whose rhetoric so sweet</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Illumin’d all Itále of poetry,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As Linian<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2430" id="noteref-2430" epub:type="noteref">2430</a> did of philosophy,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or law, or other art particulére:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But death, that will not suffer us dwell here</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But as it were a twinkling of an eye,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Them both hath slain, and allë we shall die.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“But forth to tellen of this worthy man,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That taughtë me this tale, as I began,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I say that first he with high style inditeth</span>
					<br/>
					<span>(Ere he the body of his talë writeth)</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A proem, in the which describeth he</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Piedmont, and of Saluces<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2431" id="noteref-2431" epub:type="noteref">2431</a> the countrý,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And speaketh of the Pennine hillës high,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That be the bounds of all West Lombardy:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And of Mount Vesulus in special,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Where as the Po out of a wellë small</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Taketh his firstë springing and his source,</span>

					<br/>
					<span>And truëly, as to my judgëment,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Me thinketh it a thing impertinent,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2434" id="noteref-2434" epub:type="noteref">2434</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Save that he would conveyë his mattére:</span>

						<span>A marquis whilom lord was of that land,</span>

					<p>
						<span>Therewith he was, to speak of lineage,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The gentilest y-born of Lombardy,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A fair persón, and strong, and young of age,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And full of honour and of courtesy:</span>

						<span>Or ellës could he well shew such mattére),</span>

						<span>He to the marquis said as ye shall hear.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>“O noble Marquis! your humanity</span>

						<span>Assureth us and gives us hardiness,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As oft as time is of necessity,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That we to you may tell our heaviness:</span>

						<span>Acceptë, Lord, now of your gentleness,</span>

						<span>More than another man hath in this place,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Yet forasmuch as ye, my Lord so dear,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Have always shewed me favour and grace,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>I dare the better ask of you a space</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of audience, to shewen our request,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And ye, my Lord, to do right as you lest.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2447" id="noteref-2447" epub:type="noteref">2447</a></span>

					<p>
						<span>“For certes, Lord, so well us likë you</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And all your work, and ev’r have done, that we</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Ne couldë not ourselves devisë how</span>
						<br/>
						<span>We mightë live in more felicity:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Save one thing, Lord, if that your will it be,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That for to be a wedded man you lest;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Then were your people in sovereign heart’s rest.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2448" id="noteref-2448" epub:type="noteref">2448</a></span>

						<span>“Bowë your neck under the blissful yoke</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of sovereignty, and not of servíce,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Which that men call espousal or wedlóck:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And thinkë, Lord, among your thoughtës wise,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>How that our dayës pass in sundry wise;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For though we sleep, or wake, or roam, or ride,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Aye fleeth time, it will no man abide.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>“And though your greenë youthë flow’r as yet,</span>

						<span>In creepeth age always as still as stone,</span>

						<span>That we shall die, as uncertáin we all</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Be of that day when death shall on us fall.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>“Acceptë then of us the true intent,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2450" id="noteref-2450" epub:type="noteref">2450</a></span>
						<br/>
						<span>That never yet refused yourë hest,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2451" id="noteref-2451" epub:type="noteref">2451</a></span>
						<br/>
						<span>And we will, Lord, if that ye will assent,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Choose you a wife, in short time at the lest,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2452" id="noteref-2452" epub:type="noteref">2452</a></span>
						<br/>
						<span>Born of the gentilest and of the best</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of all this land, so that it ought to seem</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Honour to God and you, as we can deem.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>“Deliver us out of all this busy dread,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2453" id="noteref-2453" epub:type="noteref">2453</a></span>
						<br/>
						<span>And take a wife, for highë Goddë’s sake:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For if it so befell, as God forbid,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That through your death your lineage should slake,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2454" id="noteref-2454" epub:type="noteref">2454</a></span>
						<br/>
						<span>And that a strange successor shouldë take</span>

						<span>Your heritage, oh! woe were us on live:<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2455" id="noteref-2455" epub:type="noteref">2455</a></span>
						<br/>
						<span>Wherefore we pray you hastily to wive.”</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Their meekë prayer and their piteous cheer</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Made the marquis for to have pitý.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>“Ye will,” quoth he, “mine owen people dear,</span>

						<span>Where I was free, I must be in serváge!<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2457" id="noteref-2457" epub:type="noteref">2457</a></span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>“But natheless I see your true intent,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And trust upon your wit, and have done aye:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Wherefore of my free will I will assent</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To weddë me, as soon as e’er I may.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But whereas ye have proffer’d me to-day</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To choosë me a wife, I you release</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That choice, and pray you of that proffer cease.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>“For God it wot, that children often been</span>

						<br/>
						<span>Of which they be engender’d and y-bore:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>I trust in Goddë’s bounté, and therefore</span>
						<br/>
						<span>My marriage, and mine estate and rest,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>I him betake;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2460" id="noteref-2460" epub:type="noteref">2460</a> he may do as him lest.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>“Let me alone in choosing of my wife;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That charge upon my back I will endure:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But I you pray, and charge upon your life,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That what wife that I take, ye me assure</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To worship<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2461" id="noteref-2461" epub:type="noteref">2461</a> her, while that her life may dure,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In word and work both here and ellëswhere,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As she an emperorë’s daughter were.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>“And farthermore this shall ye swear, that ye</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Against my choice shall never grudge<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2462" id="noteref-2462" epub:type="noteref">2462</a> nor strive.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For since I shall forego my liberty</span>

						<span>At your request, as ever may I thrive,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Where as mine heart is set, there will I wive</span>

						<br/>
						<span>I pray you speak no more of this mattére.”</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>With heartly will they sworen and assent’</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To all this thing, there said not one wight nay:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Beseeching him of grace, ere that they went,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That he would grantë them a certain day</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of his espousal, soon as e’er he may,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For yet always the people somewhat dread<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2464" id="noteref-2464" epub:type="noteref">2464</a></span>
						<br/>
						<span>Lest that the marquis wouldë no wife wed.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>He granted them a day, such as him lest,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>On which he would be wedded sickerly,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2465" id="noteref-2465" epub:type="noteref">2465</a></span>
						<br/>
						<span>And said he did all this at their request;</span>

						<span>And they with humble heart full buxomly,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2466" id="noteref-2466" epub:type="noteref">2466</a></span>
						<br/>
						<span>Kneeling upon their knees full reverently,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Him thanked all; and thus they have an end</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of their intent, and home again they wend.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>And hereupon he to his officers</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Commanded for the feastë to purvey.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2467" id="noteref-2467" epub:type="noteref">2467</a></span>

						<br/>
						<span>And in great reverence and charity</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Her oldë poorë father foster’d she.</span>

						<span>A few sheep, spinning, on the field she kept,</span>

					<p>
						<span>Upon Griselda, this poor creatúre,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Full often sithes<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2478" id="noteref-2478" epub:type="noteref">2478</a> this marquis set his eye,</span>

						<br/>
						<span>Upon her cheer<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2481" id="noteref-2481" epub:type="noteref">2481</a> he would him oft advise;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2482" id="noteref-2482" epub:type="noteref">2482</a></span>

						<br/>
						<span>And eke her virtue, passing any wight</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of so young age, as well in cheer as deed.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For though the people have no great insight</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In virtue, he considered full right</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Her bounté,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2483" id="noteref-2483" epub:type="noteref">2483</a> and disposed that he would</span>

					</p>
					<p>
						<span>The day of wedding came, but no wight can</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Tellë what woman that it shouldë be;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For which marvail wonder’d many a man,</span>

						<span>And saidë, when they were in privity,</span>

						<span>“Will not our lord yet leave his vanity?</span>

						<span>Brooches and ringës, for Griselda’s sake,</span>

						<br/>
						<span>Approached, that this wedding shouldë be,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And all the palace put was in array,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Both hall and chamber, each in its degree,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Houses of office stuffed with plenty</span>
						<br/>
						<span>There may’st thou see of dainteous vitáille,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That may be found, as far as lasts Itále.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>This royal marquis, richëly array’d,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Lordës and ladies in his company,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The which unto the feastë werë pray’d,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And of his retinue the bach’lerý,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With many a sound of sundry melody,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Unto the village, of the which I told,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In this array the right way did they hold.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Griseld’ of this (God wot) full innocent,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That for her shapen<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2487" id="noteref-2487" epub:type="noteref">2487</a> was all this array,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To fetchë water at a well is went,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And home she came as soon as e’er she may.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For well she had heard say, that on that day</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The marquis shouldë wed, and, if she might,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>She fain would have seen somewhat of that sight.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>She thought, “I will with other maidens stand,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That be my fellows, in our door, and see</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The marchioness; and therefore will I fand<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2488" id="noteref-2488" epub:type="noteref">2488</a></span>
						<br/>
						<span>To do at home, as soon as it may be,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The labour which belongeth unto me,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And then I may at leisure her behold,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>If she this way unto the castle hold.”</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>And as she would over the threshold gon,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The marquis came and gan for her to call,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And she set down her water-pot anon</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Beside the threshold, in an ox’s stall,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And down upon her knees she gan to fall,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And with sad<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2489" id="noteref-2489" epub:type="noteref">2489</a> countenancë kneeled still,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Till she had heard what was the lordë’s will.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>The thoughtful marquis spake unto the maid</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Full soberly, and said in this mannére:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>“Where is your father, Griseldis?” he said.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And she with reverence, in humble cheer,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2490" id="noteref-2490" epub:type="noteref">2490</a></span>
						<br/>
						<span>Answered, “Lord, he is all ready here.”</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And in she went withoutë longer let,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2491" id="noteref-2491" epub:type="noteref">2491</a></span>
						<br/>
						<span>And to the marquis she her father fet.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2492" id="noteref-2492" epub:type="noteref">2492</a></span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>He by the hand then took the poorë man,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And saidë thus, when he him had aside:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>“Janicola, I neither may nor can</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Longer the pleasance of mine heartë hide;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>If that thou vouchësafe, whatso betide,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Thy daughter will I take, ere that I wend,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2493" id="noteref-2493" epub:type="noteref">2493</a></span>
						<br/>
						<span>As for my wife, unto her lifë’s end.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>“Thou lovest me, that know I well certáin,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And art my faithful liegëman y-bore,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2494" id="noteref-2494" epub:type="noteref">2494</a></span>
						<br/>
						<span>And all that liketh me, I dare well sayn</span>
						<br/>
						<span>It liketh thee; and specially therefore</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Tell me that point, that I have said before⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>If that thou wilt unto this purpose draw,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To takë me as for thy son-in-law.”</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>This sudden case<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2495" id="noteref-2495" epub:type="noteref">2495</a> the man astonied so,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That red he wax’d, abash’d,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2496" id="noteref-2496" epub:type="noteref">2496</a> and all quaking</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He stood; unnethës<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2497" id="noteref-2497" epub:type="noteref">2497</a> said he wordës mo’,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But only thus; “Lord,” quoth he, “my willing</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Is as ye will, nor against your liking</span>
						<br/>
						<span>I will no thing, mine owen lord so dear;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Right as you list governë this mattére.”</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>“Then will I,” quoth the marquis softëly,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>“That in thy chamber I, and thou, and she,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Have a collatión;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2498" id="noteref-2498" epub:type="noteref">2498</a> and know’st thou why?</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For I will ask her, if her will it be</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To be my wife, and rule her after me:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And all this shall be done in thy presénce,</span>

					</p>
					<p>
						<span>And in the chamber while they were about</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The treaty, which ye shall hereafter hear,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The people came into the house without,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And wonder’d them in how honést mannére</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And tenderly she kept her father dear;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But utterly Griseldis wonder might,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For never erst<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2500" id="noteref-2500" epub:type="noteref">2500</a> ne saw she such a sight.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>No wonder is though that she be astoned,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2501" id="noteref-2501" epub:type="noteref">2501</a></span>
						<br/>
						<span>To see so great a guest come in that place,</span>

						<br/>
						<span>For which she looked with full palë face.</span>

						<span>These are the wordës that the marquis said</span>

					<p>
						<span>“Griseld’,” he said, “ye shall well understand,</span>

						<span>It liketh to your father and to me</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That I you wed, and eke it may so stand,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As I suppose ye will that it so be:</span>

						<br/>
						<span>And eke when I say Yea, ye say not Nay,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Neither by word, nor frowning countenance?</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Swear this, and here I swear our álliance.”</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Wond’ring upon this word, quaking for dread,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>She saidë; “Lord, indigne and unworthy</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Am I to this honoúr that ye me bede,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2509" id="noteref-2509" epub:type="noteref">2509</a></span>

					</p>
					<p>
						<span>“This is enough, Griselda mine,” quoth he.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And forth he went with a full sober cheer,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Out at the door, and after then came she,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And to the people he said in this mannére:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>“This is my wife,” quoth he, “that standeth here.</span>

						<span>Honoúrë her, and love her, I you pray,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Whoso me loves; there is no more to say.”</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>And, for that nothing of her oldë gear</span>
						<br/>
						<span>She shouldë bring into his house, he bade</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That women should despoilë<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2511" id="noteref-2511" epub:type="noteref">2511</a> her right there;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of which these ladies werë nothing glad</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To handle her clothës wherein she was clad:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But natheless this maiden bright of hue</span>
						<br/>
						<span>From foot to head they clothed have all new.</span>

					<p>
						<span>Her hairës have they comb’d that lay untress’d<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2512" id="noteref-2512" epub:type="noteref">2512</a></span>
						<br/>
						<span>Full rudëly, and with their fingers small</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A crown upon her head they havë dress’d,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And set her full of nouches<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2513" id="noteref-2513" epub:type="noteref">2513</a> great and small:</span>

						<span>Of her array why should I make a tale?</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Unneth<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2514" id="noteref-2514" epub:type="noteref">2514</a> the people her knew for her fairnéss,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>When she transmuted was in such richéss.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>The marquis hath her spoused with a ring</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Brought for the samë cause, and then her set</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Upon a horse snow-white, and well ambling,</span>
						<br/>

						<span>In revel, till the sunnë gan descend.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>And, shortly forth this talë for to chase,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>I say, that to this newë marchioness</span>

						<span>God hath such favour sent her of his grace,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That it ne seemed not by likeliness</span>
						<br/>

						<br/>
						<span>As in a cot, or in an ox’s stall⁠—</span>

					<p>
						<span>To every wight she waxen<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2516" id="noteref-2516" epub:type="noteref">2516</a> is so dear</span>

						<br/>
						<span>That to Janicol’ of whom I spake before,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>She was not daughter, for by conjectúre</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Them thought she was another creatúre.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>For though that ever virtuous was she,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>She was increased in such excellence</span>

						<br/>
						<span>And couldë so the people’s heart embrace,</span>

						<span>That each her lov’d that looked on her face.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Not only of Saluces in the town</span>

						<span>In Goddë’s peace lived full easily</span>

						<span>But natheless so sad steadfást was she,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That she endured all adversity,</span>

						<span>In patience suffer all this array;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And forth he went with dreary countenance;</span>

						<span>But to his heart it was full great pleasánce.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>This ugly sergeant, in the samë wise</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That he her daughter caught, right so hath he</span>
						<br/>

						<br/>
						<span>Y-hent<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2595" id="noteref-2595" epub:type="noteref">2595</a> her son, that full was of beauty:</span>

						<span>And ever-in-one<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2596" id="noteref-2596" epub:type="noteref">2596</a> so patient was she,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That she no cheerë made of heaviness,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But kiss’d her son, and after gan him bless.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Save this she prayed him, if that he might,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Her little son he would in earthë grave,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2597" id="noteref-2597" epub:type="noteref">2597</a></span>
						<br/>
						<span>His tender limbës, delicate to sight,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>From fowlës and from beastës for to save.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But she none answer of him mightë have;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He went his way, as him nothing ne raught,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2598" id="noteref-2598" epub:type="noteref">2598</a></span>
						<br/>
						<span>But to Bologna tenderly it brought.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>The marquis wonder’d ever longer more</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Upon her patience; and, if that he</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Not haddë soothly knowen therebefore</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That perfectly her children loved she,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He would have ween’d<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2599" id="noteref-2599" epub:type="noteref">2599</a> that of some subtilty,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And of malíce, or for cruel coráge,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2600" id="noteref-2600" epub:type="noteref">2600</a></span>
						<br/>
						<span>She haddë suffer’d this with sad<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2601" id="noteref-2601" epub:type="noteref">2601</a> viságe.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>But well he knew, that, next himself, certáin</span>
						<br/>
						<span>She lov’d her children best in every wise.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But now of women would I askë fain,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>If these assayës mightë not suffice?</span>
						<br/>
						<span>What could a sturdy<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2602" id="noteref-2602" epub:type="noteref">2602</a> husband more devise</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To prove her wifehood and her steadfastness,</span>

					</p>
					<p>
						<span>But there be folk of such conditión,</span>

						<span>That, when they have a certain purpose take,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Thiey cannot stint<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2603" id="noteref-2603" epub:type="noteref">2603</a> of their intentión,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But, right as they were bound unto a stake,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>They will not of their firstë purpose slake:<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2604" id="noteref-2604" epub:type="noteref">2604</a></span>
						<br/>
						<span>Right so this marquis fully hath purpós’d</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To tempt his wife, as he was first dispos’d.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>He waited, if by word or countenance</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That she to him was changed of coráge:<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2605" id="noteref-2605" epub:type="noteref">2605</a></span>
						<br/>
						<span>But never could he findë variance,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>She was aye one in heart and in viságe,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And aye the farther that she was in age,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The morë true (if that it were possíble)</span>
						<br/>
						<span>She was to him in love, and more penible.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2606" id="noteref-2606" epub:type="noteref">2606</a></span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>For which it seemed thus, that of them two</span>
						<br/>
						<span>There was but one will; for, as Walter lest,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2607" id="noteref-2607" epub:type="noteref">2607</a></span>
						<br/>
						<span>The same pleasáncë was her lust also;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And, God be thanked, all fell for the best.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>She shewed well, for no worldly unrest,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A wife as of herself no thingë should</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Will, in effect, but as her husband would.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>The sland’r of Walter wondrous widë sprad,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That of a cruel heart he wickedly,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2608" id="noteref-2608" epub:type="noteref">2608</a> he a poorë woman wedded had,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Had murder’d both his children privily:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Such murmur was among them commonly.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>No wonder is: for to the people’s ear</span>
						<br/>
						<span>There came no word, but that they murder’d were.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>For which, whereas his people therebefore</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Had lov’d him well, the sland’r of his diffame<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2609" id="noteref-2609" epub:type="noteref">2609</a></span>
						<br/>
						<span>Made them that they him hated therëfore.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To be a murd’rer is a hateful name.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But natheless, for earnest or for game,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He of his cruel purpose would not stent;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2610" id="noteref-2610" epub:type="noteref">2610</a></span>
						<br/>
						<span>To tempt his wife was set all his intent.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>When that his daughter twelve year was of age,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He to the Court of Rome, in subtle wise</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Informed of his will, sent his messáge,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2611" id="noteref-2611" epub:type="noteref">2611</a></span>
						<br/>
						<span>Commanding him such bullës to devise</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As to his cruel purpose may suffice,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>How that the Popë, for his people’s rest,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Bade him to wed another, if him lest.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2612" id="noteref-2612" epub:type="noteref">2612</a></span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>I say he bade they shouldë counterfeit</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The Pope’s bullës, making mentión</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That he had leave his firstë wife to lete,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2613" id="noteref-2613" epub:type="noteref">2613</a></span>
						<br/>
						<span>As by the Popë’s dispensatión,</span>

						<br/>
						<span>Betwixt his people and him: thus spake the bull,</span>

						<span>The which they havë published at full.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>The rudë people, as no wonder is,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Weened<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2615" id="noteref-2615" epub:type="noteref">2615</a> full well that it had been right so:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But, when these tidings came to Griseldis.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>I deemë that her heart was full of woe;</span>

						<br/>
						<span>But, shortly if this story tell I shall,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The marquis written hath in special</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A letter, in which he shewed his intent,</span>

					<p>
						<span>To th’ earl of Panico, which haddë tho<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2618" id="noteref-2618" epub:type="noteref">2618</a></span>

						<br/>
						<span>To bringë home again his children two</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In honourable estate all openly:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But one thing he him prayed utterly,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That he to no wight, though men would inquere,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Shouldë not tell whose children that they were,</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>But say, the maiden should y-wedded be</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Unto the marquis of Salúce anon.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And as this earl was prayed, so did he,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For, at day set, he on his way is gone</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Toward Salúce, and lordës many a one</span>

						<span>For, out of doubt, this oldë poorë man</span>

						<br/>
						<span>O! many a tear on many a piteous face</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Down ran of them that stoodë her beside,</span>

						<span>The ladies, when that they their timë sey,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2714" id="noteref-2714" epub:type="noteref">2714</a></span>
						<br/>
						<span>Have taken her, and into chamber gone,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And stripped her out of her rude array,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And in a cloth of gold that brightly shone,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And with a crown of many a richë stone</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Upon her head, they into hall her brought:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And there she was honoúred as her ought.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Thus had this piteous day a blissful end;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For every man and woman did his might</span>
						<br/>
						<span>This day in mirth and revel to dispend,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Till on the welkin<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2715" id="noteref-2715" epub:type="noteref">2715</a> shone the starrës bright:</span>
						<br/>

						<span>This feastë was, and greater of costage,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2716" id="noteref-2716" epub:type="noteref">2716</a></span>
						<br/>
						<span>Than was the revel of her marriáge.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Full many a year in high prosperity</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Lived these two in concord and in rest;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And richëly his daughter married he</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Unto a lord, one of the worthiest</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of all Itále; and then in peace and rest</span>
						<br/>
						<span>His wifë’s father in his court he kept,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Till that the soul out of his body crept.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>His son succeeded in his heritage,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In rest and peace, after his father’s day:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And fortunate was eke in marriáge,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>All<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2717" id="noteref-2717" epub:type="noteref">2717</a> he put not his wife in great assay:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>This world is not so strong, it is no nay,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2718" id="noteref-2718" epub:type="noteref">2718</a></span>
						<br/>
						<span>As it hath been in oldë timës yore;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And hearken what this author saith, therefore;</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>This story is said,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2719" id="noteref-2719" epub:type="noteref">2719</a> not for that wivës should</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Follow Griselda in humility,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For it were importáble<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2720" id="noteref-2720" epub:type="noteref">2720</a> though they would;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But for that every wight in his degree</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Shouldë be constant in adversity,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As was Griselda; therefore Petrarch writeth</span>
						<br/>
						<span>This story, which with high style he inditeth.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>For, since a woman was so patient</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Unto a mortal man, well more we ought</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Receiven all in gree<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2721" id="noteref-2721" epub:type="noteref">2721</a> that God us sent.</span>

						<br/>
						<span>But he tempteth no man that he hath bought,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As saith Saint James, if ye his ’pistle read;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He proveth folk all day, it is no dread.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2723" id="noteref-2723" epub:type="noteref">2723</a></span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>And suffereth us, for our exercise,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With sharpë scourges of adversity</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Full often to be beat in sundry wise;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Not for to know our will, for certes he,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Ere we were born, knew all our fraïlty;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And for our best is all his governance;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Let us then live in virtuous sufferance.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>But one word, lordings, hearken, ere I go:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>It were full hard to findë now-a-days</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In all a town Griseldas three or two:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For, if that they were put to such assays,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The gold of them hath now so bad allays<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2724" id="noteref-2724" epub:type="noteref">2724</a></span>
						<br/>
						<span>With brass, that though the coin be fair at eye,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2725" id="noteref-2725" epub:type="noteref">2725</a></span>
						<br/>
						<span>It wouldë rather break in two than ply.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2726" id="noteref-2726" epub:type="noteref">2726</a></span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>For which here, for the Wifë’s love of Bath⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Whose life and all her sex may God maintain</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In high mast’rý, and ellës were it scath⁠—<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2727" id="noteref-2727" epub:type="noteref">2727</a></span>
						<br/>
						<span>I will, with lusty heartë fresh and green,</span>

						<span>Say you a song to gladden you, I ween:</span>
