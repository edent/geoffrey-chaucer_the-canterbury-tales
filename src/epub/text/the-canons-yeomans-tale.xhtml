				<p>
					<span>When ended was the life of Saint Cecile,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Ere we had ridden fully fivë mile,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4608" id="noteref-4608" epub:type="noteref">4608</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>At Boughton-under-Blee us gan o’ertake</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A man, that clothed was in clothës black,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And underneath he wore a white surplíce.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His hackenay,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4609" id="noteref-4609" epub:type="noteref">4609</a> which was all pomely-gris,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4610" id="noteref-4610" epub:type="noteref">4610</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>So sweated, that it wonder was to see;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>It seem’d as he had pricked<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4611" id="noteref-4611" epub:type="noteref">4611</a> milës three.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The horse eke that his yeoman rode upon</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So sweated, that unnethës<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4612" id="noteref-4612" epub:type="noteref">4612</a> might he gon.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>About the peytrel<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4613" id="noteref-4613" epub:type="noteref">4613</a> stood the foam full high;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He was of foam, as flecked<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4614" id="noteref-4614" epub:type="noteref">4614</a> as a pie.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A mailë twyfold<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4615" id="noteref-4615" epub:type="noteref">4615</a> on his crupper lay;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>It seemed that he carried little array;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>All light for summer rode this worthy man.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And in my heart to wonder I began</span>
					<br/>
					<span>What that he was, till that I understood</span>
					<br/>
					<span>How that his cloak was sewed to his hood;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For which, when I had long advised<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4616" id="noteref-4616" epub:type="noteref">4616</a> me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I deemed him some Canon for to be.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His hat hung at his back down by a lace,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4617" id="noteref-4617" epub:type="noteref">4617</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>For he had ridden more than trot or pace;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He haddë pricked like as he were wood.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4618" id="noteref-4618" epub:type="noteref">4618</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>A clote-leaf<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4619" id="noteref-4619" epub:type="noteref">4619</a> he had laid under his hood,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For sweat, and for to keep his head from heat.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But it was joyë for to see him sweat;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His forehead dropped as a stillatory<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4620" id="noteref-4620" epub:type="noteref">4620</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Were full of plantain or of paritory.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4621" id="noteref-4621" epub:type="noteref">4621</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And when that he was come, he gan to cry,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“God save,” quoth he, “this jolly company.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Fast have I pricked,” quoth he, “for your sake,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Becausë that I would you overtake,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To riden in this merry company.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His Yeoman was eke full of courtesy,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And saidë, “Sirs, now in the morning tide</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Out of your hostelry I saw you ride,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And warned here my lord and sovereign,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Which that to ridë with you is full fain,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For his disport; he loveth dalliance.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Friend, for thy warning God give thee good chance,”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4622" id="noteref-4622" epub:type="noteref">4622</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Said ourë Host; “certáin it wouldë seem</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thy lord were wise, and so I may well deem;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He is full jocund also, dare I lay;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Can he aught tell a merry tale or tway,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With which he gladden may this company?”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Who, Sir? my lord? Yea, Sir, withoutë lie,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He can<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4623" id="noteref-4623" epub:type="noteref">4623</a> of mirth and eke of jollity</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Not but<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4624" id="noteref-4624" epub:type="noteref">4624</a> enough; also, Sir, trustë me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>An’<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4625" id="noteref-4625" epub:type="noteref">4625</a> ye him knew all so well as do I,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Ye would wonder how well and craftily</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He couldë work, and that in sundry wise.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He hath take on him many a great emprise,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Which were full hard for any that is here</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To bring about, but<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4626" id="noteref-4626" epub:type="noteref">4626</a> they of him it lear.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4627" id="noteref-4627" epub:type="noteref">4627</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>As homely as he rides amongës you,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>If ye him knew, it would be for your prow:<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4628" id="noteref-4628" epub:type="noteref">4628</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Ye wouldë not forego his ácquaintánce</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For muchë good, I dare lay in balance</span>
					<br/>
					<span>All that I have in my possessión.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He is a man of high discretión.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I warn you well, he is a passing<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4629" id="noteref-4629" epub:type="noteref">4629</a> man.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Well,” quoth our Host, “I pray thee tell me than,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Is he a clerk,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4630" id="noteref-4630" epub:type="noteref">4630</a> or no? Tell what he is.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Nay, he is greater than a clerk, y-wis,”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4631" id="noteref-4631" epub:type="noteref">4631</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Saidë this Yeoman; “and, in wordës few,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Host, of his craft somewhat I will you shew.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I say, my lord can<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4632" id="noteref-4632" epub:type="noteref">4632</a> such a subtletý</span>
					<br/>
					<span>(But all his craft ye may not weet<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4633" id="noteref-4633" epub:type="noteref">4633</a> of me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And somewhat help I yet to his workíng),</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That all the ground on which we be ridíng</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Till that we come to Canterbury town,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He could all cleanë turnen up so down,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And pave it all of silver and of gold.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>And when this Yeoman had this talë told</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Unto our Host, he said; “<i xml:lang="la">Ben’dicite!</i></span>
					<br/>
					<span>This thing is wonder marvellous to me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Since that thy lord is of so high prudénce,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Because of which men should him reverence,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That of his worship<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4634" id="noteref-4634" epub:type="noteref">4634</a> recketh he so lite;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4635" id="noteref-4635" epub:type="noteref">4635</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>His overest slop<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4636" id="noteref-4636" epub:type="noteref">4636</a> it is not worth a mite</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As in effect to him, so may I go;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4637" id="noteref-4637" epub:type="noteref">4637</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>It is all baudy<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4638" id="noteref-4638" epub:type="noteref">4638</a> and to-tore also.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Why is thy lord so sluttish, I thee pray,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And is of power better clothes to bey,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4639" id="noteref-4639" epub:type="noteref">4639</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>If that his deed accordeth with thy speech?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Tellë me that, and that I thee beseech.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Why?” quoth this Yeoman, “whereto ask ye me?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>God help me so, for he shall never thé<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4640" id="noteref-4640" epub:type="noteref">4640</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>(But I will not avowë<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4641" id="noteref-4641" epub:type="noteref">4641</a> that I say,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And therefore keep it secret, I you pray);</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He is too wise, in faith, as I believe.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thing that is overdone, it will not preve<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4642" id="noteref-4642" epub:type="noteref">4642</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Aright, as clerkës say; it is a vice;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Wherefore in that I hold him lew’d<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4643" id="noteref-4643" epub:type="noteref">4643</a> and nice.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4644" id="noteref-4644" epub:type="noteref">4644</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>For when a man hath over great a wit,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Full oft him happens to misusen it;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So doth my lord, and that me grieveth sore.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>God it amend; I can say now no more.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Thereof no force,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4645" id="noteref-4645" epub:type="noteref">4645</a> good Yeoman,” quoth our Host;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Since of the conning<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4646" id="noteref-4646" epub:type="noteref">4646</a> of thy lord, thou know’st,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Tell how he doth, I pray thee heartilý,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Since that be is so crafty and so sly.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4647" id="noteref-4647" epub:type="noteref">4647</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Where dwellë ye, if it to tellë be?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“In the suburbës of a town,” quoth he,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Lurking in hernës<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4648" id="noteref-4648" epub:type="noteref">4648</a> and in lanës blind,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Where as these robbers and these thieves by kind<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4649" id="noteref-4649" epub:type="noteref">4649</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Holdë their privy fearful residence,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As they that darë not show their presénce,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So farë we, if I shall say the soothë.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4650" id="noteref-4650" epub:type="noteref">4650</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Yet,” quoth our Hostë, “let me talkë tó thee;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Why art thou so discolour’d of thy face?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Peter!”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4651" id="noteref-4651" epub:type="noteref">4651</a> quoth he, “God give it hardë grace,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4652" id="noteref-4652" epub:type="noteref">4652</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>I am so us’d the hotë fire to blow,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That it hath changed my coloúr, I trow;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I am not wont in no mirrór to pry,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But swinkë<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4653" id="noteref-4653" epub:type="noteref">4653</a> sore, and learn to multiply.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4654" id="noteref-4654" epub:type="noteref">4654</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>We blunder<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4655" id="noteref-4655" epub:type="noteref">4655</a> ever, and poren<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4656" id="noteref-4656" epub:type="noteref">4656</a> in the fire,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And, for all that, we fail of our desire;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For ever we lack our conclusión.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To muchë folk we do<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4657" id="noteref-4657" epub:type="noteref">4657</a> illusión,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And borrow gold, be it a pound or two,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or ten or twelve, or many summës mo’,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And make them weenen,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4658" id="noteref-4658" epub:type="noteref">4658</a> at the leastë way,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That of a poundë we can makë tway.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Yet is it false; and aye we have good hope</span>
					<br/>
					<span>It for to do, and after it we grope:<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4659" id="noteref-4659" epub:type="noteref">4659</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>But that sciénce is so far us beforn,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That we may not, although we had it sworn,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>It overtake, it slides away so fast;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>It will us makë beggars at the last.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>While this Yeomán was thus in his talkíng,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This Canon drew him near, and heard all thing</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Which this Yeomán spake, for suspición</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of mennë’s speech ever had this Canón:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For Cato saith, that he that guilty is,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Deemeth all things be spoken of him y-wis;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4660" id="noteref-4660" epub:type="noteref">4660</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Because of that he gan so nigh to draw</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To his Yeomán, that he heard all his saw;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4661" id="noteref-4661" epub:type="noteref">4661</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And thus he said unto his Yeoman tho;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4662" id="noteref-4662" epub:type="noteref">4662</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Hold thou thy peace, and speak no wordës mo’:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For if thou do, thou shalt it dear abie.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4663" id="noteref-4663" epub:type="noteref">4663</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thou slanderest me here in this companý,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And eke discoverest that thou shouldest hide.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Yea,” quoth our Host, “tell on, whatso betide;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of all his threatening reck not a mite.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“In faith,” quoth he, “no more do I but lite.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4664" id="noteref-4664" epub:type="noteref">4664</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And when this Canon saw it would not be</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But his Yeoman would tell his privitý,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He fled away for very sorrow and shame.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Ah!” quoth the Yeoman, “here shall rise a game;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4665" id="noteref-4665" epub:type="noteref">4665</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>All that I can anon I will you tell,</span>

					<br/>
					<span>For ne’er hereafter will I with him meet,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For penny nor for pound, I you behete.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4667" id="noteref-4667" epub:type="noteref">4667</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>He that me broughtë first unto that game,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Ere that he die, sorrow have he and shame.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For it is earnest<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4668" id="noteref-4668" epub:type="noteref">4668</a> to me, by my faith;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That feel I well, what so any man saith;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And yet for all my smart, and all my grief,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For all my sorrow, labour, and mischíef,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4669" id="noteref-4669" epub:type="noteref">4669</a></span>

					<span>I couldë never leave it in no wise.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Now would to God my wittë might suffice</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To tellen all that longeth to that art!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But natheless yet will I tellë part;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Since that my lord is gone, I will not spare;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Such thing as that I know, I will declare.”</span>

					<span>Ah! nay, let be; the philosópher’s stone,</span>

					<br/>
					<span>For all our craft, when we have all y-do,</span>

					<span>And all our sleight, he will not come us to.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He hath y-made us spendë muchë good,</span>

					<span>For sorrow of which almost we waxed wood,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4721" id="noteref-4721" epub:type="noteref">4721</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>But that good hopë creeped in our heart,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Supposing ever, though we sorë smart,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To be relieved by him afterward.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Such súpposing and hope is sharp and hard.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I warn you well it is to seeken ever.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That future <i xml:lang="fr">temps</i><a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4722" id="noteref-4722" epub:type="noteref">4722</a> hath madë men dissever,</span>

					<span>Yet of that art they cannot waxë sad,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4723" id="noteref-4723" epub:type="noteref">4723</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>For unto them it is a bitter sweet;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So seemeth it; for had they but a sheet</span>

					<span>Which that they mightë wrap them in at night,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And a bratt<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4724" id="noteref-4724" epub:type="noteref">4724</a> to walk in by dayëlight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They would them sell, and spend it on this craft;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They cannot stint,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4725" id="noteref-4725" epub:type="noteref">4725</a> until no thing be laft.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And evermore, wherever that they gon,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Men may them knowë by smell of brimstóne;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For all the world they stinken as a goat;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Their savour is so rammish and so hot,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That though a man a milë from them be,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The savour will infect him, trustë me.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Lo, thus by smelling and threadbare array,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>If that men list, this folk they knowë may.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And if a man will ask them privily,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Why they be clothed so unthriftily,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4726" id="noteref-4726" epub:type="noteref">4726</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>They right anon will rownen<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4727" id="noteref-4727" epub:type="noteref">4727</a> in his ear,</span>

					<span>And sayen, if that they espied were,</span>

					<span>Lo, thus these folk betrayen innocence!</span>

					<span>Pass over this; I go my tale unto.</span>

					<span>We fail alway of that which we would have;</span>

					<span>Right so, lo, fareth it amongës us.</span>

				<p>
					<span>There was a canon of religioún</span>

					<span>Amongës us, would ínfect all a town,</span>

					<span>When he commúnë shall with any wight,</span>

					<br/>
					<span>Full many a man hath he beguil’d ere this,</span>

					<span>And if you list to give me audiénce,</span>

					<span>This talë was not only told for you,</span>

					<br/>
					<span>That amongës Christë’s apostlës twelve</span>

					<span>There was no traitor but Judas himselve;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then why should all the remenant have blame,</span>

					<span>If any Judas in your convent be,</span>

					<span>In London was a priest, an annualére,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4764" id="noteref-4764" epub:type="noteref">4764</a></span>

					<span>That therein dwelled haddë many a year,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Which was so pleasant and so serviceáble</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Unto the wife, where as he was at table,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That she would suffer him no thing to pay</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For board nor clothing, went he ne’er so gay;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And spending silver had he right enow;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thereof no force;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4765" id="noteref-4765" epub:type="noteref">4765</a> will proceed as now,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And tellë forth my tale of the canón,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That brought this priestë to confusión.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This falsë canon came upon a day</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Unto the priestë’s chamber, where he lay,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Beseeching him to lend him a certáin</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of gold, and he would quit it him again.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Lend me a mark,” quoth he, “but dayës three,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And at my day I will it quitë thee.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And if it so be that thou find me false,</span>
					<br/>

					<span>This priest him took a mark, and that as swithe,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4767" id="noteref-4767" epub:type="noteref">4767</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And this canón him thanked often sithe,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4768" id="noteref-4768" epub:type="noteref">4768</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And took his leave, and wentë forth his way;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And at the thirdë day brought his monéy;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And to the priest he took his gold again,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Whereof this priest was wondrous glad and fain.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4769" id="noteref-4769" epub:type="noteref">4769</a></span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Certes,” quoth he, “nothing annoyeth me<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4770" id="noteref-4770" epub:type="noteref">4770</a></span>

					<span>But takë heed, Sirs, now for Goddë’s love.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He took his coal, of which I spake above,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And in his hand he bare it privily,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And while the priestë couched busily</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The coalës, as I toldë you ere this,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This canon saidë, “Friend, ye do amiss;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This is not couched as it ought to be,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But soon I shall amenden it,” quoth he.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Now let me meddle therewith but a while,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For of you have I pity, by Saint Gile.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Ye be right hot, I see well how ye sweat;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Have here a cloth, and wipe away the wet.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And whilë that the priestë wip’d his face,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This canon took his coal⁠—with sorry grace<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4811" id="noteref-4811" epub:type="noteref">4811</a>⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And layed it above on the midwárd</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of the croslet, and blew well afterward,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Till that the coals begannë fast to brenn.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4812" id="noteref-4812" epub:type="noteref">4812</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Now give us drinkë,” quoth this canon then,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“And swithe<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4813" id="noteref-4813" epub:type="noteref">4813</a> all shall be well, I undertake.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Sittë we down, and let us merry make.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And whennë that this canon’s beechen coal</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Was burnt, all the limáile out of the hole</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Into the crossëlet anon fell down;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And so it mustë needës, by reasoún,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Since it above so even couched<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4814" id="noteref-4814" epub:type="noteref">4814</a> was;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But thereof wist the priest no thing, alas!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He deemed all the coals alikë good,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For of the sleight he nothing understood.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>And when this alchemister saw his time,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Rise up, Sir Priest,” quoth he, “and stand by me;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And, for I wot well ingot<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4815" id="noteref-4815" epub:type="noteref">4815</a> have ye none,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Go, walkë forth, and bring me a chalk stone;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For I will make it of the samë shape</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That is an ingot, if I may have hap.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Bring eke with you a bowl, or else a pan,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Full of watér, and ye shall well see than<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4816" id="noteref-4816" epub:type="noteref">4816</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>How that our business shall hap and preve.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4817" id="noteref-4817" epub:type="noteref">4817</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And yet, for ye shall have no misbelieve<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4818" id="noteref-4818" epub:type="noteref">4818</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Nor wrong conceit of me, in your absénce,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I willë not be out of your presénce,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But go with you, and come with you again.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The chamber-doorë, shortly for to sayn,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They opened and shut, and went their way,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And forth with them they carried the key;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And came again without any delay.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Why should I tarry all the longë day?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He took the chalk, and shap’d it in the wise</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of an ingot, as I shall you devise;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4819" id="noteref-4819" epub:type="noteref">4819</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>I say, he took out of his owen sleeve</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A teine<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4820" id="noteref-4820" epub:type="noteref">4820</a> of silver (evil may he cheve!<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4821" id="noteref-4821" epub:type="noteref">4821</a>)</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Which that ne was but a just ounce of weight.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And takë heed now of his cursed sleight;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He shap’d his ingot, in length and in brede<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4822" id="noteref-4822" epub:type="noteref">4822</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of this teinë, withouten any drede,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4823" id="noteref-4823" epub:type="noteref">4823</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>So slily, that the priest it not espied;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And in his sleeve again he gan it hide;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And from the fire he took up his mattére,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And in th’ ingot put it with merry cheer;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4824" id="noteref-4824" epub:type="noteref">4824</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And in the water-vessel he it cast,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When that him list, and bade the priest as fast</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Look what there is; “Put in thine hand and grope;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4825" id="noteref-4825" epub:type="noteref">4825</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>There shalt thou findë silver, as I hope.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>What, devil of hellë! should it ellës be?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Shaving of silver, silver is, pardie.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He put his hand in, and took up a teine<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4826" id="noteref-4826" epub:type="noteref">4826</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of silver fine; and glad in every vein</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Was this priest, when he saw that it was so.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Goddë’s blessing, and his mother’s also,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And allë hallows’,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4827" id="noteref-4827" epub:type="noteref">4827</a> have ye, Sir Canón!”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Saidë this priest, “and I their malison<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4828" id="noteref-4828" epub:type="noteref">4828</a></span>

					<span>But, an’<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4829" id="noteref-4829" epub:type="noteref">4829</a> ye vouchësafe to teachë me</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This noble craft and this subtilitý,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I will be yours in all that ever I may.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Quoth the canón, “Yet will I make assay<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4830" id="noteref-4830" epub:type="noteref">4830</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>The second time, that ye may takë heed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And be expert of this, and, in your need,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Another day assay in mine absénce</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This discipline, and this crafty sciénce.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Let take another ouncë,” quoth he tho,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4831" id="noteref-4831" epub:type="noteref">4831</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Of quicksilver, withoutë wordës mo’,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And do therewith as ye have done ere this</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With that other, which that now silver is.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>The priest him busied, all that e’er he can,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To do as this canón, this cursed man,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Commanded him, and fast he blew the fire</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For to come to th’ effect of his desire.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And this canón right in the meanëwhile</span>
					<br/>
					<span>All ready was this priest eft<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4832" id="noteref-4832" epub:type="noteref">4832</a> to beguile,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>and, for a countenance,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4833" id="noteref-4833" epub:type="noteref">4833</a> in his handë bare</span>
					<br/>
					<span>An hollow stickë (take keep<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4834" id="noteref-4834" epub:type="noteref">4834</a> and beware);</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In th’ end of which an ouncë and no more</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of silver limaile put was, as before</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Was in his coal, and stopped with wax well</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For to keep in his limaile every deal.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4835" id="noteref-4835" epub:type="noteref">4835</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And while this priest was in his business,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This canon with his stickë gan him dress<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4836" id="noteref-4836" epub:type="noteref">4836</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>To him anon, and his powder cast in,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As he did erst<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4837" id="noteref-4837" epub:type="noteref">4837</a> (the devil out of his skin</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Him turn, I pray to God, for his falsehéad,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For he was ever false in thought and deed),</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And with his stick, above the crossëlet,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That was ordained with that falsë get,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4838" id="noteref-4838" epub:type="noteref">4838</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>He stirr’d the coalës, till relentë gan</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The wax against the fire, as every man,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But he a fool be, knows well it must need.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And all that in the stickë was out yede,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4839" id="noteref-4839" epub:type="noteref">4839</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And in the croslet hastily<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4840" id="noteref-4840" epub:type="noteref">4840</a> it fell.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Now, goodë Sirs, what will ye bet<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4841" id="noteref-4841" epub:type="noteref">4841</a> than well?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When that this priest was thus beguil’d again,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Supposing naught but truthë, sooth to sayn,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He was so glad, that I can not express</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In no mannére his mirth and his gladnéss;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And to the canon he proffér’d eftsoon<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4842" id="noteref-4842" epub:type="noteref">4842</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Body and good. “Yea,” quoth the canon soon,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Though poor I be, crafty<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4843" id="noteref-4843" epub:type="noteref">4843</a> thou shalt me find;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I warn thee well, yet is there more behind.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Is any copper here within?” said he.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Yea, Sir,” the priestë said, “I trow there be.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Ellës go buy us some, and that as swithë.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4844" id="noteref-4844" epub:type="noteref">4844</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Now, goodë Sir, go forth thy way and hie<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4845" id="noteref-4845" epub:type="noteref">4845</a> thee.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He went his way, and with the copper came,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And this canón it in his handës name,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4846" id="noteref-4846" epub:type="noteref">4846</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And of that copper weighed out an ounce.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Too simple is my tonguë to pronounce,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As minister of my wit, the doubleness</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of this canon, root of all cursedness.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He friendly seem’d to them that knew him not;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But he was fiendly, both in work and thought.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>It wearieth me to tell of his falsenéss;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And natheless yet will I it express,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To that intent men may beware thereby,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And for none other causë truëly.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He put this copper in the crossëlet,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And on the fire as swithe<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4847" id="noteref-4847" epub:type="noteref">4847</a> he hath it set,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And cast in powder, and made the priest to blow,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And in his working for to stoopë low,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As he did erst,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4848" id="noteref-4848" epub:type="noteref">4848</a> and all was but a jape;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4849" id="noteref-4849" epub:type="noteref">4849</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Right as him list the priest he made his ape.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4850" id="noteref-4850" epub:type="noteref">4850</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And afterward in the ingot he it cast,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And in the pan he put it at the last</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of water, and in he put his own hand;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And in his sleeve, as ye beforëhand</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Heardë me tell, he had a silver teine;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4851" id="noteref-4851" epub:type="noteref">4851</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>He silly took it out, this cursed heine<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4852" id="noteref-4852" epub:type="noteref">4852</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>(Unweeting<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4853" id="noteref-4853" epub:type="noteref">4853</a> this priest of his falsë craft),</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And in the pannë’s bottom he it laft.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4854" id="noteref-4854" epub:type="noteref">4854</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And in the water rumbleth to and fro,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And wondrous privily took up alsó</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The copper teine (not knowing thilkë priest),</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And hid it, and him hentë<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4855" id="noteref-4855" epub:type="noteref">4855</a> by the breast,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And to him spake, and thus said in his game;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Stoop now adown; by God, ye be to blame;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Helpë me now, as I did you whilére;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4856" id="noteref-4856" epub:type="noteref">4856</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Put in your hand, and lookë what is there.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>This priest took up this silver teine anon;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And thennë said the canon, “Let us gon,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With these three teinës which that we have wrought,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To some goldsmith, and weet if they be aught:<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4857" id="noteref-4857" epub:type="noteref">4857</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>For, by my faith, I would not for my hood</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But if<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4858" id="noteref-4858" epub:type="noteref">4858</a> they werë silver fine and good,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And that as swithe<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4859" id="noteref-4859" epub:type="noteref">4859</a> well proved shall it be.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Unto the goldsmith with these teinës three</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They went anon, and put them in assay<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4860" id="noteref-4860" epub:type="noteref">4860</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>To fire and hammer; might no man say nay,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But that they weren as they ought to be.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This sotted<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4861" id="noteref-4861" epub:type="noteref">4861</a> priest, who gladder was than he?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Was never bird gladder against the day;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Nor nightingale in the season of May</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Was never none, that better list to sing;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Nor lady lustier in carolling,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or for to speak of love and womanhead;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Nor knight in arms to do a hardy deed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To standen in grace of his lady dear,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Than had this priest this craftë for to lear;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And to the canon thus he spake and said;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“For love of God, that for us allë died,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And as I may deserve it unto you,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>What shall this réceipt costë? tell me now.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“By our Lady,” quoth this canon, “it is dear.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I warn you well, that, save I and a frere,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In Engleland there can no man it make.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“No force,”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4862" id="noteref-4862" epub:type="noteref">4862</a> quoth he; “now, Sir, for Goddë’s sake,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>What shall I pay? tellë me, I you pray.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Y-wis,”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4863" id="noteref-4863" epub:type="noteref">4863</a> quoth he, “it is full dear, I say.</span>

					<br/>
					<span>This priest the sum of forty pound anon</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of nobles fet,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4865" id="noteref-4865" epub:type="noteref">4865</a> and took them every one</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To this canón, for this ilkë receipt.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>All his workíng was but fraud and deceit.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Sir Priest,” he said, “I keep<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4866" id="noteref-4866" epub:type="noteref">4866</a> to have no los<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4867" id="noteref-4867" epub:type="noteref">4867</a></span>

					<span>This multiplying blint<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4876" id="noteref-4876" epub:type="noteref">4876</a> so many a one,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That in good faith I trowë that it be</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The causë greatest of such scarcity.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>These philosóphers speak so mistily</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In this craft, that men cannot come thereby,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For any wit that men have how-a-days.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They may well chatter, as do thesë jays,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And in their termës set their lust and pain,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4877" id="noteref-4877" epub:type="noteref">4877</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>But to their purpose shall they ne’er attain.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A man may lightly<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4878" id="noteref-4878" epub:type="noteref">4878</a> learn, if he have aught,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To multiply, and bring his good to naught.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Lo, such a lucre<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4879" id="noteref-4879" epub:type="noteref">4879</a> is in this lusty<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4880" id="noteref-4880" epub:type="noteref">4880</a> game;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A mannë’s mirth it will turn all to grame,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4881" id="noteref-4881" epub:type="noteref">4881</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And empty also great and heavy purses,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And makë folkë for to purchase curses</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of them that have thereto their good y-lent.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Oh, fy for shamë! they that have been brent,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4882" id="noteref-4882" epub:type="noteref">4882</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Alas! can they not flee the firë’s heat?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Ye that it use, I rede<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4883" id="noteref-4883" epub:type="noteref">4883</a> that ye it lete,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4884" id="noteref-4884" epub:type="noteref">4884</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Lest ye lose all; for better than never is late;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Never to thrivë, were too long a date.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Though ye prowl aye, ye shall it never find;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Ye be as bold as is Bayard the blind,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That blunders forth, and peril casteth none;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4885" id="noteref-4885" epub:type="noteref">4885</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>He is as bold to run against a stone,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As for to go beside it in the way:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So farë ye that multiply, I say.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>If that your eyen cannot see aright,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Look that your mindë lackë not his sight.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For though you look never so broad, and stare,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Ye shall not win a mite on that chaffare,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4886" id="noteref-4886" epub:type="noteref">4886</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>But wasten all that ye may rape and renn.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4887" id="noteref-4887" epub:type="noteref">4887</a></span>
					<br/>

					<br/>
					<span>Meddle no morë with that art, I mean;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For if ye do, your thrift<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4889" id="noteref-4889" epub:type="noteref">4889</a> is gone full clean.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And right as swithe<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4890" id="noteref-4890" epub:type="noteref">4890</a> I will you tellë here</span>
					<br/>
					<span>What philosóphers say in this mattére.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Lo, thus saith Arnold of the newë town,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4891" id="noteref-4891" epub:type="noteref">4891</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>As his Rosáry maketh mentioún,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He saith right thus, withouten any lie;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“There may no man mercúry mortify,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4892" id="noteref-4892" epub:type="noteref">4892</a> it be with his brother’s knowledging.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Lo, how that he, which firstë said this thing,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of philosóphers father was, Hermés;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4893" id="noteref-4893" epub:type="noteref">4893</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>He saith, how that the dragon doubtëless</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He dieth not, but if that he be slain</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With his brother. And this is for to sayn,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>By the dragón, Mercúry, and none other,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He understood, and Brimstone by his brother,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That out of Sol and Luna were y-draw.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4894" id="noteref-4894" epub:type="noteref">4894</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>“And therefore,” said he, “take heed to my saw.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4895" id="noteref-4895" epub:type="noteref">4895</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Let no man busy him this art to seech,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4896" id="noteref-4896" epub:type="noteref">4896</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>But if<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4897" id="noteref-4897" epub:type="noteref">4897</a> that he th’ intentión and speech</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of philosóphers understandë can;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And if he do, he is a lewëd<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4898" id="noteref-4898" epub:type="noteref">4898</a> man.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For this sciénce and this conning,”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4899" id="noteref-4899" epub:type="noteref">4899</a> quoth he,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Is of the secret of secrets<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4900" id="noteref-4900" epub:type="noteref">4900</a> pardie.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Also there was a disciple of Plató,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That on a timë said his master to,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As his book, Senior,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4901" id="noteref-4901" epub:type="noteref">4901</a> will bear witnéss,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And this was his demand in soothfastness:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Tell me the name of thilkë<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4902" id="noteref-4902" epub:type="noteref">4902</a> privy stone.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And Plato answer’d unto him anon;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Takë the stone that Titanos men name.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Which is that?” quoth he. “Magnesia is the same,”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Saidë Plató. “Yea, Sir, and is it thus?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This is <i xml:lang="la">ignotum per ignotius</i>.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4903" id="noteref-4903" epub:type="noteref">4903</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>What is Magnesia, good Sir, I pray?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“It is a water that is made, I say,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of th’ elementës fourë,” quoth Plató.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Tell me the rootë, good Sir,” quoth he tho,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4904" id="noteref-4904" epub:type="noteref">4904</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Of that watér, if that it be your will.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Nay, nay,” quoth Plato, “certain that I n’ill.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4905" id="noteref-4905" epub:type="noteref">4905</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>The philosóphers sworn were every one,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That they should not discover it to none,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Nor in no book it write in no mannére;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For unto God it is so lefe<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4906" id="noteref-4906" epub:type="noteref">4906</a> and dear,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That he will not that it discover’d be,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But where it liketh to his deity</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Man for to inspire, and eke for to defend<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4907" id="noteref-4907" epub:type="noteref">4907</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Whom that he liketh; lo, this is the end.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Then thus conclude I, since that God of heaven</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Will not that thesë philosóphers neven<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4908" id="noteref-4908" epub:type="noteref">4908</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>How that a man shall come unto this stone,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I rede<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4909" id="noteref-4909" epub:type="noteref">4909</a> as for the best to let it gon.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For whoso maketh God his adversáry,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As for to work any thing in contráry</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of his will, certes never shall he thrive,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Though that he multiply term of his live.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4910" id="noteref-4910" epub:type="noteref">4910</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And there a point;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4911" id="noteref-4911" epub:type="noteref">4911</a> for ended is my tale.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>God send ev’ry good man boot of his bale.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4912" id="noteref-4912" epub:type="noteref">4912</a></span>
