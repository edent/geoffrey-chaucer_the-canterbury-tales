					<span>“Ho!” quoth the Knight, “good sir, no more of this;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That ye have said is right enough, y-wis,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4235" id="noteref-4235" epub:type="noteref">4235</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And muchë more; for little heaviness</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Is right enough to muchë folk, I guess.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I say for me, it is a great disease,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4236" id="noteref-4236" epub:type="noteref">4236</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Where as men have been in great wealth and ease,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To hearen of their sudden fall, alas!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And the contráry is joy and great solas,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4237" id="noteref-4237" epub:type="noteref">4237</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>As when a man hath been in poor estate,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And climbeth up, and waxeth fortunate,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And there abideth in prosperity;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Such thing is gladsome, as it thinketh me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And of such thing were goodly for to tell.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Yea,” quoth our Hostë, “by Saint Paulë’s bell.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Ye say right sooth; this monk hath clapped<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4238" id="noteref-4238" epub:type="noteref">4238</a> loud;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He spake how Fortune cover’d with a cloud</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I wot not what, and als’ of a tragédy</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Right now ye heard: and pardie no remédy</span>
					<br/>
					<span>It is for to bewailë, nor complain</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That that is done, and also it is pain,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As ye have said, to hear of heaviness.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Sir Monk, no more of this, so God you bless;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Your tale annoyeth all this company;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Such talking is not worth a butterfly,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For therein is there no sport nor game;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Therefore, Sir Monkë, Dan Piers by your name,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I pray you heart’ly, tell us somewhat else,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For sickerly, n’ere clinking of your bells,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4239" id="noteref-4239" epub:type="noteref">4239</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>That on your bridle hang on every side,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>By heaven’s king, that for us allë died,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I should ere this have fallen down for sleep,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Although the slough had been never so deep;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then had your talë been all told in vain.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For certainly, as thesë clerkës sayn,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Where as a man may have no audience,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Nought helpeth it to tellë his senténce.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And well I wot the substance is in me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>If anything shall well reported be.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Sir, say somewhat of hunting,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4240" id="noteref-4240" epub:type="noteref">4240</a> I you pray.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Nay,” quoth the Monk, “I have no lust to play;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4241" id="noteref-4241" epub:type="noteref">4241</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Now let another tell, as I have told.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then spake our Host with rudë speech and bold,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And said unto the Nunnë’s Priest anon,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Come near, thou Priest, come hither, thou Sir John,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4242" id="noteref-4242" epub:type="noteref">4242</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Tell us such thing as may our heartës glade.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4243" id="noteref-4243" epub:type="noteref">4243</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Be blithe, although thou ride upon a jade.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>What though thine horse be bothë foul and lean?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>If he will serve thee, reck thou not a bean;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Look that thine heart be merry evermo’.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Yes, Host,” quoth he, “so may I ride or go,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4244" id="noteref-4244" epub:type="noteref">4244</a> I be merry, y-wis I will be blamed.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And right anon his tale he hath attamed;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4245" id="noteref-4245" epub:type="noteref">4245</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And thus he said unto us every one,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This sweetë priest, this goodly man, Sir John.</span>

					<span>A poor widow, somedeal y-stept<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4247" id="noteref-4247" epub:type="noteref">4247</a> in age,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Was whilom dwelling in a poor cottáge,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Beside a grovë, standing in a dale.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This widow, of which I tellë you my tale,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Since thilkë day that she was last a wife,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In patiénce led a full simple life,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For little was her chattel and her rent.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4248" id="noteref-4248" epub:type="noteref">4248</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>By husbandry<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4249" id="noteref-4249" epub:type="noteref">4249</a> of such as God her sent,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>She found<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4250" id="noteref-4250" epub:type="noteref">4250</a> herself, and eke her daughters two.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Three largë sowës had she, and no mo’;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Three kine, and eke a sheep that hightë Mall.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Full sooty was her bow’r,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4251" id="noteref-4251" epub:type="noteref">4251</a> and eke her hall,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In which she ate full many a slender meal.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of poignant saucë knew she never a deal.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4252" id="noteref-4252" epub:type="noteref">4252</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>No dainty morsel passed through her throat;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Her diet was accordant to her cote.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4253" id="noteref-4253" epub:type="noteref">4253</a></span>

					<span>The goutë let her nothing<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4256" id="noteref-4256" epub:type="noteref">4256</a> for to dance,</span>

					<br/>
					<span>No winë drank she, neither white nor red:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Her board was served most with white and black,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Milk and brown bread, in which she found no lack,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Seind<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4258" id="noteref-4258" epub:type="noteref">4258</a> bacon, and sometimes an egg or tway;</span>

					<span>For she was as it were a manner dey.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4259" id="noteref-4259" epub:type="noteref">4259</a></span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>A yard<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4260" id="noteref-4260" epub:type="noteref">4260</a> she had, enclosed all about</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With stickës, and a dryë ditch without,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In which she had a cock, hight Chanticleer;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In all the land of crowing n’as<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4261" id="noteref-4261" epub:type="noteref">4261</a> his peer.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4262" id="noteref-4262" epub:type="noteref">4262</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>His voice was merrier than the merry orgón,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4263" id="noteref-4263" epub:type="noteref">4263</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>On massë days that in the churches gon.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Well sickerer<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4264" id="noteref-4264" epub:type="noteref">4264</a> was his crowing in his lodge,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Than is a clock, or an abbáy horloge.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4265" id="noteref-4265" epub:type="noteref">4265</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>By nature he knew each ascensioún</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of th’ equinoctial in thilkë town;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For when degrees fiftenë were ascended,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then crew he, that it might not be amended.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His comb was redder than the fine corál,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Embattell’d<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4266" id="noteref-4266" epub:type="noteref">4266</a> as it were a castle wall.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His bill was black, and as the jet it shone;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Like azure were his leggës and his tone;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4267" id="noteref-4267" epub:type="noteref">4267</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>His nailës whiter than the lily flow’r,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And like the burnish’d gold was his coloúr,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This gentle cock had in his governánce</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Sev’n hennës, for to do all his pleasánce,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Which were his sisters and his paramours,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And wondrous like to him as of coloúrs.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of which the fairest-hued in the throat</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Was called Damosellë Partelote,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Courteous she was, discreet, and debonair,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And cómpaniáble,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4268" id="noteref-4268" epub:type="noteref">4268</a> and bare herself so fair,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Sincë the day that she sev’n night was old,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That truëly she had the heart in hold</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of Chanticleer, locked in every lith;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4269" id="noteref-4269" epub:type="noteref">4269</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>He lov’d her so, that well was him therewith.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But such a joy it was to hear them sing,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When that the brightë sunnë gan to spring,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In sweet accord, “My lefe<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4270" id="noteref-4270" epub:type="noteref">4270</a> is fare<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4271" id="noteref-4271" epub:type="noteref">4271</a> in land.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4272" id="noteref-4272" epub:type="noteref">4272</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>For, at that time, as I have understand,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Beastës and birdës couldë speak and sing.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>And so befell, that in a dawëning,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As Chanticleer among his wivës all</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Sat on his perchë, that was in the hall,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And next him sat this fairë Partelote,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This Chanticleer gan groanen in his throat,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As man that in his dream is dretched<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4273" id="noteref-4273" epub:type="noteref">4273</a> sore,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And when that Partelote thus heard him roar,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>She was aghast,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4274" id="noteref-4274" epub:type="noteref">4274</a> and saidë, “Heartë dear,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>What aileth you to groan in this mannére?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Ye be a very sleeper, fy for shame!”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And he answer’d and saidë thus; “Madame,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I pray you that ye take it not agrief;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4275" id="noteref-4275" epub:type="noteref">4275</a></span>

					<br/>
					<span>Right now, that yet mine heart is sore affright’.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Now God,” quoth he, “my sweven<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4278" id="noteref-4278" epub:type="noteref">4278</a> read aright,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And keep my body out of foul prisoún.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Me mette,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4279" id="noteref-4279" epub:type="noteref">4279</a> how that I roamed up and down</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Within our yard, where as I saw a beast</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Was like an hound, and would have made arrest<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4280" id="noteref-4280" epub:type="noteref">4280</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Upon my body, and would have had me dead.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His colour was betwixt yellow and red;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And tipped was his tail, and both his ears,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With black, unlike the remnant of his hairs.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His snout was small, with glowing eyen tway;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Yet of his look almost for fear I dey;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4281" id="noteref-4281" epub:type="noteref">4281</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>This caused me my groaning, doubtëless.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Away,”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4282" id="noteref-4282" epub:type="noteref">4282</a> quoth she, “fy on you, heartëless!<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4283" id="noteref-4283" epub:type="noteref">4283</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Alas!” quoth she, “for, by that God above!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Now have ye lost my heart and all my love;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I cannot love a coward, by my faith.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For certes, what so any woman saith,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>We all desiren, if it mightë be,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To have husbandës hardy, wise, and free,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And secret, and no niggard nor no fool,</span>

					<span>Nothing but vanity, God wot, in sweven is,</span>

					<br/>
					<span>And oft of fume, and of complexións,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When humours be too abundant in a wight.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Certes this dream, which ye have mette tonight,</span>

					<br/>
					<span>Of arrows, and of fire with redë beams,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of redë beastës, that they will them bite,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of conteke,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4290" id="noteref-4290" epub:type="noteref">4290</a> and of whelpës great and lite;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4291" id="noteref-4291" epub:type="noteref">4291</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Right as the humour of meláncholy</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Causeth full many a man in sleep to cry,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For fear of bullës, or of bearës blake,</span>
					<br/>

					<span>Of other humours could I tell also,</span>

					<span>That I will pass as lightly as I can.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Lo, Cato, which that was so wise a man,</span>

					<span>Said he not thus, ‘Ne do no force of<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4292" id="noteref-4292" epub:type="noteref">4292</a> dreams,’</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Now, Sir,” quoth she, “when we fly from these beams,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4293" id="noteref-4293" epub:type="noteref">4293</a></span>

					<br/>
					<span>Saith thus, that whilom two fellówës went</span>
					<br/>
					<span>On pilgrimage in a full good intent;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And happen’d so, they came into a town</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Where there was such a congregatioún</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of people, and eke so strait of herbergage,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4304" id="noteref-4304" epub:type="noteref">4304</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>That they found not as much as one cottáge</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In which they bothë might y-lodged be:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Wherefore they musten of necessity,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As for that night, departë company;</span>

					<span>And each of them went to his hostelry,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4305" id="noteref-4305" epub:type="noteref">4305</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And took his lodging as it wouldë fall.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The one of them was lodged in a stall,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Far in a yard, with oxen of the plough;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That other man was lodged well enow,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As was his áventúre, or his fortúne,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That us govérneth all, as in commúne.</span>

					<span>And said, ‘Alas! for in an ox’s stall</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This night shall I be murder’d, where I lie.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Now help me, dearë brother, or I die;</span>
					<br/>

					<br/>
					<span>But when that he was wak’d out of his sleep,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He turned him, and took of this no keep;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He thought his dream was but a vanity.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thus twiës in his sleeping dreamed he,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And at the thirdë time yet<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4308" id="noteref-4308" epub:type="noteref">4308</a> his felláw</span>

					<span>The hostelére answered him anon,</span>

					<span>That one of them, in sleeping as he lay,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He mette<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4323" id="noteref-4323" epub:type="noteref">4323</a> a wondrous dream, against the day:</span>

					<br/>
					<span>For treason; but he was but seven years old,</span>

					<span>He in a chronicle might it safely write,</span>

					<span>By high imaginatión forecast,</span>

					<span>But by necessity conditionel.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I will not have to do of such mattére;</span>

					<span>My tale is of a cock, as ye may hear,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That took his counsel of his wife, with sorrow,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To walken in the yard upon the morrow</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That he had mette the dream, as I you told.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Womanë’s counsels be full often cold;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4384" id="noteref-4384" epub:type="noteref">4384</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Womanë’s counsel brought us first to woe,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And made Adám from Paradise to go,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>There as he was full merry and well at case.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But, for I n’ot<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4385" id="noteref-4385" epub:type="noteref">4385</a> to whom I might displease</span>
					<br/>
					<span>If I counsél of women wouldë blame,</span>

					<br/>
					<span>Read authors, where they treat of such mattére,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And what they say of women ye may hear.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>These be the cockë’s wordës, and not mine;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I can no harm of no woman divine.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4387" id="noteref-4387" epub:type="noteref">4387</a></span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Fair in the sand, to bathe<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4388" id="noteref-4388" epub:type="noteref">4388</a> her merrily,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Lies Partelote, and all her sisters by,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Against the sun, and Chanticleer so free</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Sang merrier than the mermaid in the sea;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For Physiologus saith sickerly,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4389" id="noteref-4389" epub:type="noteref">4389</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>How that they singë well and merrily.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4390" id="noteref-4390" epub:type="noteref">4390</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And so befell that, as he cast his eye</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Among the wortës,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4391" id="noteref-4391" epub:type="noteref">4391</a> on a butterfly,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He was ware of this fox that lay full low.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Nothing ne list him thennë<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4392" id="noteref-4392" epub:type="noteref">4392</a> for to crow,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But cried anon “Cock! cock!” and up he start,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As man that was affrayed in his heart.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For naturally a beast desireth flee</span>
					<br/>
					<span>From his contráry,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4393" id="noteref-4393" epub:type="noteref">4393</a> if be may it see,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Though he ne’er erst<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4394" id="noteref-4394" epub:type="noteref">4394</a> had soon it with his eye</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This Chanticleer, when he gan him espy,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He would have fled, but that the fox anon</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Said, “Gentle Sir, alas! why will ye gon?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Be ye afraid of me that am your friend?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Now, certes, I were worse than any fiend,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>If I to you would harm or villainy.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I am not come your counsel to espy.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But truëly the cause of my comíng</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Was only for to hearken how ye sing;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For truëly ye have as merry a steven,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4395" id="noteref-4395" epub:type="noteref">4395</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>As any angel hath that is in heaven;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Therewith ye have of music more feelíng,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Than had Boece, or any that can sing.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>My lord your father (God his soulë bless)</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And eke your mother of her gentleness,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Have in mine housë been, to my great ease:<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4396" id="noteref-4396" epub:type="noteref">4396</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And certes, Sir, full fain would I you please.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But, for men speak of singing, I will say,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So may I brookë<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4397" id="noteref-4397" epub:type="noteref">4397</a> well mine eyen tway,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Save you, I heardë never man so sing</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As did your father in the morrowning.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Certes it was of heart all that he sung.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And, for to make his voice the morë strong,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He would so pain him,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4398" id="noteref-4398" epub:type="noteref">4398</a> that with both his eyen</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He mustë wink, so loud he wouldë cryen,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And standen on his tiptoes therewithal,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And stretchë forth his neckë long and small.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And eke he was of such discretión,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That there was no man, in no región,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That him in song or wisdom mightë pass.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I have well read in Dan Burnel the Ass,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4399" id="noteref-4399" epub:type="noteref">4399</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Among his verse, how that there was a cock</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That, for<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4400" id="noteref-4400" epub:type="noteref">4400</a> a priestë’s son gave him a knock</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Upon his leg, while he was young and nice,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4401" id="noteref-4401" epub:type="noteref">4401</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>He made him for to lose his benefice.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But certain there is no comparisón</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Betwixt the wisdom and discretión</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of yourë father, and his subtilty.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Now singë, Sir, for saintë charity,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Let see, can ye your father counterfeit?”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>This Chanticleer his wings began to beat,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As man that could not his treasón espy,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So was he ravish’d with his flattery.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Alas! ye lordës, many a false flattour<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4402" id="noteref-4402" epub:type="noteref">4402</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Is in your court, and many a losengeour,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4403" id="noteref-4403" epub:type="noteref">4403</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>That pleasë you well morë, by my faith,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Than he that soothfastness<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4404" id="noteref-4404" epub:type="noteref">4404</a> unto you saith.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Read in Ecclesiast of flattery;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Beware, ye lordës, of their treachery.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This Chanticleer stood high upon his toes,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Stretching his neck, and held his eyen close,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And gan to crowë loudë for the nonce:<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4405" id="noteref-4405" epub:type="noteref">4405</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And Dan Russel<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4406" id="noteref-4406" epub:type="noteref">4406</a> the fox start up at once,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And by the gorgat hentë<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4407" id="noteref-4407" epub:type="noteref">4407</a> Chanticleer,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And on his back toward the wood him bare.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For yet was there no man that him pursu’d.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>O destiny, that may’st not be eschew’d!<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4408" id="noteref-4408" epub:type="noteref">4408</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Alas, that Chanticleer flew from the beams!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Alas, his wifë raughtë<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4409" id="noteref-4409" epub:type="noteref">4409</a> nought of dreams!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And on a Friday fell all this mischance.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>O Venus, that art goddess of pleasánce,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Since that thy servant was this Chanticleer</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And in thy service did all his powére,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>More for delight, than the world to multiply,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Why wilt thou suffer him on thy day to die?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>O Gaufrid, dearë master sovereign,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That, when thy worthy king Richárd was slain<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4410" id="noteref-4410" epub:type="noteref">4410</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>With shot, complainedest his death so sore,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Why n’ had I now thy sentence and thy lore,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The Friday for to chiden, as did ye?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>(For on a Friday, soothly, slain was he),</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then would I shew you how that I could plain</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For Chanticleerë’s dread, and for his pain.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Certes such cry nor lamentatión</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Was ne’er of ladies made, when Ilión</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Was won, and Pyrrhus<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4411" id="noteref-4411" epub:type="noteref">4411</a> with his straightë swerd,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When he had hent king Priam by the beard,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And slain him (as saith us <i xml:lang="la">Eneidos</i>),</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As maden all the hennës in the close,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4412" id="noteref-4412" epub:type="noteref">4412</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>When they had seen of Chanticleer the sight.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But sov’reignly<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4413" id="noteref-4413" epub:type="noteref">4413</a> Dame Partelotë shright,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4414" id="noteref-4414" epub:type="noteref">4414</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Full louder than did Hasdrubalë’s wife,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When that her husband haddë lost his life,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And that the Romans had y-burnt Cartháge;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>She was so full of torment and of rage,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That wilfully into the fire she start,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And burnt herselfë with a steadfast heart.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>O woeful hennës! right so criëd ye,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As, when that Nero burned the citý</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of Romë, cried the senatorës’ wives,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For that their husbands losten all their lives;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Withoutë guilt this Nero hath them slain.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Now will I turn unto my tale again;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The sely<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4415" id="noteref-4415" epub:type="noteref">4415</a> widow, and her daughters two,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Heardë these hennës cry and makë woe,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And at the doors out started they anon,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And saw the fox toward the wood is gone,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And bare upon his back the cock away:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They criëd, “Out! harow! and well-away!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Aha! the fox!” and after him they ran,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And eke with stavës many another man</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Ran Coll our dog, and Talbot, and Garlánd;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And Malkin, with her distaff in her hand</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Ran cow and calf, and eke the very hoggës,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So fear’d they were for barking of the doggës,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And shouting of the men and women eke.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They rannë so, them thought their hearts would break.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They yelled as the fiendës do in hell;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The duckës criëd as men would them quell;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4416" id="noteref-4416" epub:type="noteref">4416</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>The geese for fearë flewen o’er the trees,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Out of the hivë came the swarm of bees,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So hideous was the noise, <i xml:lang="la">ben’dicite!</i></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Certes he, Jackë Straw,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4417" id="noteref-4417" epub:type="noteref">4417</a> and his meinie,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4418" id="noteref-4418" epub:type="noteref">4418</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Ne madë never shoutës half so shrill,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When that they woulden any Fleming kill,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As thilkë day was made upon the fox.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of brass they broughtë beamës<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4419" id="noteref-4419" epub:type="noteref">4419</a> and of box,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of horn and bone, in which they blew and pooped,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4420" id="noteref-4420" epub:type="noteref">4420</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And therewithal they shrieked and they hooped;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>It seemed as the heaven shouldë fall.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Now, goodë men, I pray you hearken all;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Lo, how Fortúnë turneth suddenly</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The hope and pride eke of her enemy.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This cock, that lay upon the fox’s back,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In all his dread unto the fox he spake,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And saidë, “Sir, if that I were as ye,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Yet would I say (as wisly<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4421" id="noteref-4421" epub:type="noteref">4421</a> God help me),</span>
					<br/>
					<span>‘Turn ye again, ye proudë churlës all;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4422" id="noteref-4422" epub:type="noteref">4422</a></span>

					<br/>
					<span>Now am I come unto the woodë’s side,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Maugré your head, the cock shall here abide;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I will him eat, in faith, and that anon.’ ”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The fox answér’d, “In faith it shall be done:”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And, as he spake the word, all suddenly</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The cock brake from his mouth deliverly,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4423" id="noteref-4423" epub:type="noteref">4423</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And high upon a tree he flew anon.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And when the fox saw that the cock was gone,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Alas!” quoth he, “O Chanticleer, alas!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I have,” quoth he, “y-done to you trespass,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4424" id="noteref-4424" epub:type="noteref">4424</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Inasmuch as I maked you afear’d,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When I you hent,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4425" id="noteref-4425" epub:type="noteref">4425</a> and brought out of your yard;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But, Sir, I did it in no wick’ intent;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Come down, and I shall tell you what I meant.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I shall say sooth to you, God help me so.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Nay then,” quoth he, “I shrew<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4426" id="noteref-4426" epub:type="noteref">4426</a> us both the two,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And first I shrew myself, both blood and bones,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>If thou beguile me oftener than once.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thou shalt no more through thy flattery</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Do<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4427" id="noteref-4427" epub:type="noteref">4427</a> me to sing and winkë with mine eye;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For he that winketh when he shouldë see,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>All wilfully, God let him never thé.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4428" id="noteref-4428" epub:type="noteref">4428</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Nay,” quoth the fox; “but God give him mischance</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That is so indiscreet of governánce,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That jangleth<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4429" id="noteref-4429" epub:type="noteref">4429</a> when that he should hold his peace.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Lo, what it is for to be reckëless</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And negligent, and trust on flattery.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But ye that holdë this tale a follý,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As of a fox, or of a cock or hen,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Take the morality thereof, good men.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For Saint Paul saith, That all that written is,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To our doctríne<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4430" id="noteref-4430" epub:type="noteref">4430</a> it written is y-wis.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4431" id="noteref-4431" epub:type="noteref">4431</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Take the fruit, and let the chaff be still.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Now goodë God, if that it be thy will,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As saith my Lord,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4432" id="noteref-4432" epub:type="noteref">4432</a> so make us all good men;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And bring us all to thy high bliss. Amen.</span>

					<span>“Sir Nunnë’s Priest,” our Hostë said anon,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Y-blessed be thy breech, and every stone;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This was a merry tale of Chanticleer.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But by my truth, if thou wert seculére,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4433" id="noteref-4433" epub:type="noteref">4433</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thou wouldest be a treadëfowl<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4434" id="noteref-4434" epub:type="noteref">4434</a> aright;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For if thou have couráge as thou hast might,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thee werë need of hennës, as I ween,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Yea more than seven timës seventeen.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>See, whatë brawnës<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4435" id="noteref-4435" epub:type="noteref">4435</a> hath this gentle priest,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So great a neck, and such a largë breast!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He looketh as a sperhawk with his eyen;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Him needeth not his colour for to dyen</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With Brazil, nor with grain of Portugale.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But, Sirë, fairë fall you for your tale.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And, after that, he with full merry cheer</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Said to another, as ye shallë hear.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4436" id="noteref-4436" epub:type="noteref">4436</a></span>
