			<p>
				<span>The minister and norice<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4438" id="noteref-4438" epub:type="noteref">4438</a> unto vices,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Which that men call in English idleness,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The porter at the gate is of delices;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4439" id="noteref-4439" epub:type="noteref">4439</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>T’ eschew, and by her contrar’ her oppress⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That is to say, by lawful business<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4440" id="noteref-4440" epub:type="noteref">4440</a>⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Well oughtë we to do our all intent,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4441" id="noteref-4441" epub:type="noteref">4441</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lest that the fiend through idleness us hent.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4442" id="noteref-4442" epub:type="noteref">4442</a></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>For he, that with his thousand cordës sly</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Continually us waiteth to beclap,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4443" id="noteref-4443" epub:type="noteref">4443</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>When he may man in idleness espy,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He can so lightly catch him in his trap,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Till that a man be hent right by the lappe,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4444" id="noteref-4444" epub:type="noteref">4444</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>He is not ware the fiend hath him in hand;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Well ought we work, and idleness withstand.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And though men dreaded never for to die,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Yet see men well by reason, doubtëless,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That idleness is root of sluggardý,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of which there cometh never good increase;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And see that sloth them holdeth in a leas,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4445" id="noteref-4445" epub:type="noteref">4445</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>Only to sleep, and for to eat and drink,</span>

				<span>And, for to put us from such idleness,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That cause is of so great confusión,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I have here done my faithful business,</span>

				<span>After the Legend, in translatión</span>

				<span>Right of thy glorious life and passión⁠—</span>

				<br/>
				<span>With mercy, goodness, and with such pitý,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That thou, that art the sun of excellence,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Not only helpest them that pray to thee,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But oftentime, of thy benignity,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Full freely, ere that men thine help beseech,</span>

			<p>
				<span>Now help, thou meek and blissful fairë maid,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Me, flemed<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4458" id="noteref-4458" epub:type="noteref">4458</a> wretch, in this desért of gall;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Think on the woman Cananée that said</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That whelpës eat some of the crumbës all</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That from their Lordë’s table be y-fall;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4459" id="noteref-4459" epub:type="noteref">4459</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>And though that I, unworthy son of Eve,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4460" id="noteref-4460" epub:type="noteref">4460</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>Be sinful, yet acceptë my believe.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4461" id="noteref-4461" epub:type="noteref">4461</a></span>

				<br/>
				<span>Where as withouten end is sung Osanne,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thou Christë’s mother, daughter dear of Anne.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And of thy light my soul in prison light,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That troubled is by the contagión</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of my bodý, and also by the weight</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of earthly lust and false affectión;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>O hav’n of refuge, O salvatión</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of them that be in sorrow and distress,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Now help, for to my work I will me dress.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Yet pray I you, that readë what I write,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4463" id="noteref-4463" epub:type="noteref">4463</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>Forgive me that I do no diligence</span>
				<br/>
				<span>This ilkë<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4464" id="noteref-4464" epub:type="noteref">4464</a> story subtilly t’ indite.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For both have I the wordës and senténce</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of him that at the saintë’s reverence</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The story wrote, and follow her legénd;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And pray you that you will my work amend.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>First will I you the name of Saint Cecílie</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Expound, as men may in her story see.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>It is to say in English, Heaven’s lily,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4465" id="noteref-4465" epub:type="noteref">4465</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>For purë chasteness of virginity;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or, for she whiteness had of honesty,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4466" id="noteref-4466" epub:type="noteref">4466</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>And green of consciénce, and of good fame</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The sweetë savour, Lilie was her name.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Or Cecilie is to say, the way of blind;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4467" id="noteref-4467" epub:type="noteref">4467</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>For she example was by good teachíng;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or else Cecilie, as I written find,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Is joined by a manner conjoiníng</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of heaven and <em>Lia</em>,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4468" id="noteref-4468" epub:type="noteref">4468</a> and herein figuríng</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The heaven is set for thought of holiness,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And <em>Lia</em> for her lasting business.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Cecilie may eke be said in this mannére,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wanting of blindness, for her greatë light</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of sapience, and for her thewës<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4469" id="noteref-4469" epub:type="noteref">4469</a> clear.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or ellës, lo, this maiden’s name bright</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of heaven and <em>Leos</em> comes, for which by right</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Men might her well the heaven of people call,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Example of good and wisë workës all;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>For <em>Leos</em> people<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4470" id="noteref-4470" epub:type="noteref">4470</a> in English is to say;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4471" id="noteref-4471" epub:type="noteref">4471</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>And right as men may in the heaven see</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The sun and moon, and starrës every way,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Right so men ghostly,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4472" id="noteref-4472" epub:type="noteref">4472</a> in this maiden free,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sawen of faith the magnanimitý,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And eke the clearness whole of sapiénce,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And sundry workës bright of excellence.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And right so as these philosóphers write,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That heav’n is swift and round, and eke burning,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Right so was fairë Cecilíe the white</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Full swift and busy in every good workíng,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And round and whole<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4473" id="noteref-4473" epub:type="noteref">4473</a> in good perséveríng,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And burning ever in charity full bright;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Now have I you declared what she hight.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4474" id="noteref-4474" epub:type="noteref">4474</a></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>This maiden bright Cecile, as her life saith,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Was come of Romans, and of noble kind,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And from her cradle foster’d in the faith</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of Christ, and bare his Gospel in her mind:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>She never ceased, as I written find,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of her prayére, and God to love and dread,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Beseeching him to keep her maidenhead.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And when this maiden should unto a man</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Y-wedded be, that was full young of age,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Which that y-called was Valerian,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And comë was the day of marriáge,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>She, full devout and humble in her coráge,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4475" id="noteref-4475" epub:type="noteref">4475</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>Under her robe of gold, that sat full fair,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Had next her flesh y-clad her in an hair.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4476" id="noteref-4476" epub:type="noteref">4476</a></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And while the organs madë melody,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To God alone thus in her heart sang she;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“O Lord, my soul and eke my body gie<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4477" id="noteref-4477" epub:type="noteref">4477</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>Unwemmed,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4478" id="noteref-4478" epub:type="noteref">4478</a> lest that I confounded be.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And, for his love that died upon the tree,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Every second or third day she fast’,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Aye bidding<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4479" id="noteref-4479" epub:type="noteref">4479</a> in her orisons full fast.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The night came, and to beddë must she gon</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With her husbánd, as it is the mannére;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And privily she said to him anon;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“O sweet and well-beloved spousë dear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There is a counsel,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4480" id="noteref-4480" epub:type="noteref">4480</a> an’<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4481" id="noteref-4481" epub:type="noteref">4481</a> ye will it hear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Which that right fain I would unto you say,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So that ye swear ye will it not bewray.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Valerian gan fast unto her swear</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That for no case nor thing that mightë be,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He never should to none bewrayen her;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And then at erst<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4482" id="noteref-4482" epub:type="noteref">4482</a> thus to him saidë she;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“I have an angel which that loveth me,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That with great love, whether I wake or sleep,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Is ready aye my body for to keep;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“And if that he may feelen, out of dread,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4483" id="noteref-4483" epub:type="noteref">4483</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>That ye me touch or love in villainy,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He right anon will slay you with the deed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And in your youthë thus ye shouldë die.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And if that ye in cleanë love me gie,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4484" id="noteref-4484" epub:type="noteref">4484</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>He will you love as me, for your cleannéss,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And shew to you his joy and his brightnéss.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Valerian, corrected as God wo’ld,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Answer’d again, “If I shall trustë thee,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Let me that angel see, and him behold;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And if that it a very angel be,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then will I do as thou hast prayed me;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And if thou love another man, forsooth</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Right with this sword then will I slay you both.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Cecile answér’d anon right in this wise;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“If that you list, the angel shall ye see,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So that ye trow<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4485" id="noteref-4485" epub:type="noteref">4485</a> Of Christ, and you baptise;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Go forth to Via Appia,” quoth she,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That from this townë<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4486" id="noteref-4486" epub:type="noteref">4486</a> stands but milës three,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And to the poorë folkës that there dwell</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Say them right thus, as that I shall you tell.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Tell them, that I, Cecile, you to them sent</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To shewë you the good Urban the old,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For secret needës,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4487" id="noteref-4487" epub:type="noteref">4487</a> and for good intent;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And when that ye Saint Urban have behold,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Tell him the wordës which I to you told;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And when that he hath purged you from sin,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then shall ye see that angel ere ye twin.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4488" id="noteref-4488" epub:type="noteref">4488</a></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Valerian is to the placë gone;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And, right as he was taught by her learning,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He found this holy old Urban anon</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Among the saintës’ burials louting;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4489" id="noteref-4489" epub:type="noteref">4489</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>And he anon, withoutë tarrying,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Did his messáge, and when that he it told,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Urban for joy his handës gan uphold.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The tearës from his eyen let he fall;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Almighty Lord, O Jesus Christ,” quoth he,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Sower of chaste counsél, herd<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4490" id="noteref-4490" epub:type="noteref">4490</a> of us all;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The fruit of thilkë<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4491" id="noteref-4491" epub:type="noteref">4491</a> seed of chastity</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That thou hast sown in Cecile, take to thee:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lo, like a busy bee, withoutë guile,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thee serveth aye thine owen thrall<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4492" id="noteref-4492" epub:type="noteref">4492</a> Cicile.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“For thilkë spousë, that she took but new,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4493" id="noteref-4493" epub:type="noteref">4493</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>Full like a fierce lión, she sendeth here,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As meek as e’er was any lamb to ewe.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And with that word anon there gan appear</span>
				<br/>
				<span>An old man, clad in whitë clothës clear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That had a book with letters of gold in hand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And gan before Valerian to stand.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Valerian, as dead, fell down for dread,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When he him saw; and he up hent<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4494" id="noteref-4494" epub:type="noteref">4494</a> him tho,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4495" id="noteref-4495" epub:type="noteref">4495</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>And on his book right thus he gan to read;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“One Lord, one faith, one God withoutë mo’,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>One Christendom, one Father of all alsó,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Aboven all, and over all everywhere.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>These wordës all with gold y-written were.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>When this was read, then said this oldë man,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Believ’st thou this or no? say yea or nay.”</span>
				<br/>

				<br/>
				<span>“What manner woman artë thou?” quoth he.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“I am a gentle woman born,” quoth she.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“I askë thee,” quoth he, “though it thee grieve,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of thy religion and of thy believe.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Ye have begun your question foolishly,”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Quoth she, “that wouldest two answérs conclude</span>

				<br/>
				<span>Almach answér’d to that similitude,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Of whencë comes thine answering so rude?”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Of whencë?” quoth she, when that she was freined,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4564" id="noteref-4564" epub:type="noteref">4564</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Of consciénce, and of good faith unfeigned.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Almachius saidë; “Takest thou no heed</span>

				<span>Of my powér?” and she him answer’d this;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Your might,” quoth she, “full little is to dread;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For every mortal mannë’s power is</span>

				<span>For with a needle’s point, when it is blow’,</span>

				<span>May all the boast of it be laid full low.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Full wrongfully begunnest thou,” quoth he,</span>

				<span>Almach answered, “Choose one of these two,</span>

				<span>Thou liest; for thy power is full naked.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Do away<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4582" id="noteref-4582" epub:type="noteref">4582</a> thy boldness,” said Almachius tho,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4583" id="noteref-4583" epub:type="noteref">4583</a></span>

				<br/>
				<span>Cecile answér’d, “O nicë<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4584" id="noteref-4584" epub:type="noteref">4584</a> creatúre,</span>

				<span>She sat all cold, and felt of it no woe,</span>

				<span>It made her not one droppë for to sweat;</span>
