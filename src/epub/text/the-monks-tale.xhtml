				<p>
					<span>When ended was my tale of Melibee,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And of Prudénce and her benignity,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Our Hostë said, “As I am faithful man,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And by the precious <i xml:lang="la">corpus Madrian</i>,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4016" id="noteref-4016" epub:type="noteref">4016</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>I had lever<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4017" id="noteref-4017" epub:type="noteref">4017</a> than a barrel of ale,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That goodë lefe<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4018" id="noteref-4018" epub:type="noteref">4018</a> my wife had heard this tale;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For she is no thing of such patiénce</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As was this Meliboeus’ wife Prudénce.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>By Goddë’s bonës! when I beat my knaves</span>
					<br/>
					<span>She bringeth me the greatë clubbed staves,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And crieth, ‘Slay the doggës every one,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And break of them both back and ev’ry bone.’</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And if that any neighëbour of mine</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Will not in church unto my wife incline,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4019" id="noteref-4019" epub:type="noteref">4019</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or be so hardy to her to trespace,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4020" id="noteref-4020" epub:type="noteref">4020</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>When she comes home she rampeth<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4021" id="noteref-4021" epub:type="noteref">4021</a> in my face,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And crieth, ‘Falsë coward, wreak<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4022" id="noteref-4022" epub:type="noteref">4022</a> thy wife:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>By <i xml:lang="la">corpus Domini</i>, I will have thy knife,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And thou shalt have my distaff, and go spin.’</span>
					<br/>
					<span>From day till night right thus she will begin.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>‘Alas!’ she saith, ‘that ever I was shape<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4023" id="noteref-4023" epub:type="noteref">4023</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>To wed a milksop, or a coward ape,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That will be overlad<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4024" id="noteref-4024" epub:type="noteref">4024</a> with every wight!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thou darest not stand by thy wifë’s right.’</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“This is my life, but if<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4025" id="noteref-4025" epub:type="noteref">4025</a> that I will fight;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And out at door anon I must me dight,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4026" id="noteref-4026" epub:type="noteref">4026</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or ellës I am lost, but if that I</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Be, like a wildë lion, fool-hardý.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I wot well she will do<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4027" id="noteref-4027" epub:type="noteref">4027</a> me slay some day</span>

					<span>For I am perilous with knife in hand,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Albeit that I dare not her withstand;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For she is big in armës, by my faith!</span>
					<br/>

					<br/>
					<span>But let us pass away from this mattére.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>My lord the Monk,” quoth he, “be merry of cheer,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For ye shall tell a talë truëlý.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Lo, Rochester stands here fastë by.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Ride forth, mine owen lord, break not our game.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But by my troth I cannot tell your name;</span>

					<span>Whether shall I call you my lord Dan John,</span>

					<span>Or Dan Thomas, or ellës Dan Albon?</span>
					<br/>

					<br/>
					<span>I vow to God, thou hast a full fair skin;</span>

					<span>It is a gentle pasture where thou go’st;</span>

					<span>Thou art not like a penant<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4030" id="noteref-4030" epub:type="noteref">4030</a> or a ghost.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Upon my faith thou art some officer,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Some worthy sexton, or some cellarer.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For by my father’s soul, as to my dome,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4031" id="noteref-4031" epub:type="noteref">4031</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thou art a master when thou art at home;</span>

					<span>No poorë cloisterer, nor no novíce,</span>

					<br/>
					<span>And therewithal, of brawnës<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4032" id="noteref-4032" epub:type="noteref">4032</a> and of bones,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A right well-faring person for the nonce.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I pray to God give him confusión</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That first thee brought into religión.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thou would’st have been a treadëfowl<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4033" id="noteref-4033" epub:type="noteref">4033</a> aright;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Hadst thou as greatë leave, as thou hast might,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To perform all thy lust in engendrure,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thou hadst begotten many a creatúre.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Alas! why wearest thou so wide a cope?<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4034" id="noteref-4034" epub:type="noteref">4034</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>God give me sorrow, but, an’<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4035" id="noteref-4035" epub:type="noteref">4035</a> I were pope,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Not only thou, but every mighty man,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Though he were shorn full high upon his pan,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4036" id="noteref-4036" epub:type="noteref">4036</a></span>

					<br/>
					<span>Religión hath ta’en up all the corn</span>

					<span>Of treading, and we borel<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4038" id="noteref-4038" epub:type="noteref">4038</a> men be shrimps:<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4039" id="noteref-4039" epub:type="noteref">4039</a></span>

					<br/>
					<span>This maketh that our heirës be so slender</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And feeble, that they may not well engender.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This maketh that our wives will assay</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Religious folk, for they may better pay</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of Venus’ payëmentës than may we:</span>

					<span>God wot, no lushëburghës<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4041" id="noteref-4041" epub:type="noteref">4041</a> payë ye.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But be not wroth, my lord, though that I play;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Full oft in game a sooth have I heard say.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>This worthy Monk took all in patiénce,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And said, “I will do all my diligence,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As far as souneth unto honesty,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4042" id="noteref-4042" epub:type="noteref">4042</a></span>

					<span>Of him that stood in great prosperitý,</span>

					<br/>
					<span>In prose eke be indited many a one,</span>

					<br/>
					<span>Was driven out of his prosperity</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To labour, and to hell, and to mischance.</span>
				</p>

				<p>
					<span>Lo <b>Sampson</b>, which that was annunciate</span>

					<span>By the angel, long ere his nativity;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4051" id="noteref-4051" epub:type="noteref">4051</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And was to God Almighty consecrate,</span>

					<br/>
					<span>But to his wivës told he his secré,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Through which he slew himself for wretchedness.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Sampson, this noble and mighty champión,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Withoutë weapon, save his handës tway,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He slew and all to-rentë<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4053" id="noteref-4053" epub:type="noteref">4053</a> the lión,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Toward his wedding walking by the way.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His falsë wife could him so please, and pray,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Till she his counsel knew; and she, untrue,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Unto his foes his counsel gan bewray,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And him forsook, and took another new.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Three hundred foxes Sampson took for ire,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And all their tailës he together band,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And set the foxes’ tailës all on fire,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For he in every tail had knit a brand,</span>

				<p>
					<span>When they were slain, so thirsted him, that he</span>

					<span>And send him drink, or ellës must he die;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And of this ass’s check, that was so dry,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Out of a wang-tooth<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4056" id="noteref-4056" epub:type="noteref">4056</a> sprang anon a well,</span>

				</p>
				<p>

					<br/>
					<span>And on his back y-carried them hath he</span>
					<br/>
					<span>High on an hill, where as men might them see.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>O noble mighty Sampson, lefe<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4059" id="noteref-4059" epub:type="noteref">4059</a> and dear,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Hadst thou not told to women thy secré,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In all this world there had not been thy peer.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>This Sampson never cider drank nor wine,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Nor on his head came razor none nor shear,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>By precept of the messenger divine;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For all his strengthës in his hairës were;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And fully twenty winters, year by year,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He had of Israel the governance;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But soonë shall he weepë many a tear,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For women shall him bringë to mischance.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Unto his leman<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4060" id="noteref-4060" epub:type="noteref">4060</a> Dalila<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4061" id="noteref-4061" epub:type="noteref">4061</a> he told,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That in his hairës all his strengthë lay;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And falsely to his foemen she him sold,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And sleeping in her barme<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4062" id="noteref-4062" epub:type="noteref">4062</a> upon a day</span>
					<br/>
					<span>She made to clip or shear his hair away,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And made his foemen all his craft espien.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And when they foundë him in this array,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They bound him fast, and put out both his eyen.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>But, ere his hair was clipped or y-shave,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>There was no bond with which men might him bind;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But now is he in prison in a cave,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Where as they made him at the quernë<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4063" id="noteref-4063" epub:type="noteref">4063</a> grind.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>O noble Sampson, strongest of mankind!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>O whilom judge in glory and richéss!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Now may’st thou weepë with thine eyen blind,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Since thou from weal art fall’n to wretchedness.</span>

				<p>
					<span>Th’ end of this caitiff<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4064" id="noteref-4064" epub:type="noteref">4064</a> was as I shall say;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His foemen made a feast upon a day,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And made him as their fool before them play;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And this was in a temple of great array.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But at the last he made a foul affray,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For he two pillars shook, and made them fall,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And down fell temple and all, and there it lay,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And slew himself and eke his foemen all;</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>This is to say, the princes every one;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And eke three thousand bodies were there slain</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With falling of the great temple of stone.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of Sampson now will I no morë sayn;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Beware by this example old and plain,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That no man tell his counsel to his wife</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of such thing as he would have secret fain,</span>

					<span>And like a beast he seemed for to be,</span>

					<span>In rain, with wildë beastës walked he,</span>
