					<span>When folk had laughed all at this nice case</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of Absolon and Hendy Nicholas,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Diversë folk diversëly they said,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But for the morë part they laugh’d and play’d;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1189" id="noteref-1189" epub:type="noteref">1189</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And at this tale I saw no man him grieve,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But it were only Osëwold the Reeve.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Because he was of carpentérë’s craft,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A little ire is in his heartë laft;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1190" id="noteref-1190" epub:type="noteref">1190</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>He gan to grudge<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1191" id="noteref-1191" epub:type="noteref">1191</a> and blamed it a lite.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1192" id="noteref-1192" epub:type="noteref">1192</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>“So thé I,”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1193" id="noteref-1193" epub:type="noteref">1193</a> quoth he, “full well could I him quite<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1194" id="noteref-1194" epub:type="noteref">1194</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>With blearing<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1195" id="noteref-1195" epub:type="noteref">1195</a> of a proudë miller’s eye,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>If that me list to speak of ribaldry.</span>

					<br/>
					<span>Mine heart is also moulded<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1198" id="noteref-1198" epub:type="noteref">1198</a> as mine hairs;</span>

					<span>That ilkë<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1200" id="noteref-1200" epub:type="noteref">1200</a> fruit is ever longer werse,</span>

					<br/>
					<span>For in our will there sticketh aye a nail,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To have an hoary head and a green tail,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As hath a leek; for though our might be gone,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Our will desireth folly ever-in-one:<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1203" id="noteref-1203" epub:type="noteref">1203</a></span>

					<span>For when we may not do, then will we speak,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Yet in our ashes cold does firë reek.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1204" id="noteref-1204" epub:type="noteref">1204</a></span>

					<br/>
					<span>As many a year as it is passed and gone</span>

					<span>Till that almost all empty is the tun.</span>

				</p>
				<p>
					<span>When that our Host had heard this sermoning,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He gan to speak as lordly as a king,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And said; “To what amounteth all this wit?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>What? shall we speak all day of holy writ?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The devil made a Reevë for to preach,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As of a souter<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1214" id="noteref-1214" epub:type="noteref">1214</a> a shipman, or a leach.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1215" id="noteref-1215" epub:type="noteref">1215</a></span>

					<span>Lo Greenwich, where many a shrew is in.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>It were high time thy talë to begin.”</span>

					<span>“Now, sirs,” quoth then this Osëwold the Reeve,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“I pray you all that none of you do grieve,</span>

					<span>At Trompington, not far from Cantebrig,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1221" id="noteref-1221" epub:type="noteref">1221</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>There goes a brook, and over that a brig,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Upon the whichë brook there stands a mill:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And this is very sooth that I you tell.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A miller was there dwelling many a day,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As any peacock he was proud and gay:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Pipen he could, and fish, and nettës bete,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1222" id="noteref-1222" epub:type="noteref">1222</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And turnë cups, and wrestle well, and shete.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1223" id="noteref-1223" epub:type="noteref">1223</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Aye by his belt he bare a long pavade,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1224" id="noteref-1224" epub:type="noteref">1224</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And of his sword full trenchant was the blade.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A jolly popper<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1225" id="noteref-1225" epub:type="noteref">1225</a> bare he in his pouch;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>There was no man for peril durst him touch.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A Sheffield whittle bare he in his hose.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Round was his face, and camuse<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1226" id="noteref-1226" epub:type="noteref">1226</a> was his nose.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As pilled<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1227" id="noteref-1227" epub:type="noteref">1227</a> as an apë’s was his skull.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He was a market-beter at the full.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1228" id="noteref-1228" epub:type="noteref">1228</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>There durstë no wight hand upon him legge,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1229" id="noteref-1229" epub:type="noteref">1229</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>That he ne swore anon he should abegge.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1230" id="noteref-1230" epub:type="noteref">1230</a></span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>A thief he was, for sooth, of corn and meal,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And that a sly, and used well to steal.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His name was hoten deinous Simekin.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1231" id="noteref-1231" epub:type="noteref">1231</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>A wife he haddë, come of noble kin:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The parson of the town her father was.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With her he gave full many a pan of brass,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For that Simkin should in his blood ally.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>She was y-foster’d in a nunnery:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For Simkin wouldë no wife, as he said,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But she were well y-nourish’d, and a maid,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To saven his estate and yeomanry:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And she was proud, and pert as is a pie.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1232" id="noteref-1232" epub:type="noteref">1232</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>A full fair sight it was to see them two;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>On holy days before her would he go</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With his tippét<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1233" id="noteref-1233" epub:type="noteref">1233</a> y-bound about his head;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And she came after in a gite<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1234" id="noteref-1234" epub:type="noteref">1234</a> of red,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And Simkin haddë hosen of the same.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>There durstë no wight call her aught but Dame:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>None was so hardy, walking by that way,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That with her either durstë rage or play,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1235" id="noteref-1235" epub:type="noteref">1235</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>But if<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1236" id="noteref-1236" epub:type="noteref">1236</a> he would be slain by Simekin</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With pavade, or with knife, or bodëkin.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For jealous folk be per’lous evermo’:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Algate<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1237" id="noteref-1237" epub:type="noteref">1237</a> they would their wivës wendë so.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1238" id="noteref-1238" epub:type="noteref">1238</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And eke for she was somewhat smutterlich,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1239" id="noteref-1239" epub:type="noteref">1239</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>She was as dign<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1240" id="noteref-1240" epub:type="noteref">1240</a> as water in a ditch,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And all so full of hoker,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1241" id="noteref-1241" epub:type="noteref">1241</a> and bismare.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1242" id="noteref-1242" epub:type="noteref">1242</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Her thoughtë that a lady should her spare,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1243" id="noteref-1243" epub:type="noteref">1243</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>What for her kindred, and her nortelrie<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1244" id="noteref-1244" epub:type="noteref">1244</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>That she had learned in the nunnery.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>One daughter haddë they betwixt them two</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of twenty year, withouten any mo,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Saving a child that was of half year age,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In cradle it lay, and was a proper page.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1245" id="noteref-1245" epub:type="noteref">1245</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>This wenchë thick and well y-growen was,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With camuse nose, and eyen gray as glass;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With buttocks broad, and breastës round and high;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But right fair was her hair, I will not lie.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The parson of the town, for she was fair,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1246" id="noteref-1246" epub:type="noteref">1246</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>In purpose was to make of her his heir</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Both of his chattels and his messuage,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And strange he made it of<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1247" id="noteref-1247" epub:type="noteref">1247</a> her marriáge.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His purpose was for to bestow her high</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Into some worthy blood of ancestry.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For holy Church’s good may be dispended<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1248" id="noteref-1248" epub:type="noteref">1248</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>On holy Church’s blood that is descended.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Therefore he would his holy blood honoúr,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Though that he holy Churchë should devour.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Great soken<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1249" id="noteref-1249" epub:type="noteref">1249</a> hath this miller, out of doubt,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With wheat and malt, of all the land about;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And namëly<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1250" id="noteref-1250" epub:type="noteref">1250</a> there was a great collége</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Men call the Soler Hall at Cantebrege,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1251" id="noteref-1251" epub:type="noteref">1251</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>There was their wheat and eke their malt y-ground.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And on a day it happed in a stound,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1252" id="noteref-1252" epub:type="noteref">1252</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Sick lay the manciple<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1253" id="noteref-1253" epub:type="noteref">1253</a> of a malady,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Men weened wisly<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1254" id="noteref-1254" epub:type="noteref">1254</a> that he shouldë die.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For which this miller stole both meal and corn</span>
					<br/>
					<span>An hundred timës morë than beforn.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For theretofore he stole but courteously,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But now he was a thief outrageously.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For which the warden chid and madë fare,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1255" id="noteref-1255" epub:type="noteref">1255</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>But thereof set the miller not a tare;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1256" id="noteref-1256" epub:type="noteref">1256</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>He crack’d his boast,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1257" id="noteref-1257" epub:type="noteref">1257</a> and swore it was not so.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Then were there youngë poorë scholars two,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That dwelled in the hall of which I say;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Testif<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1258" id="noteref-1258" epub:type="noteref">1258</a> they were, and lusty for to play;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And only for their mirth and revelry</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Upon the warden busily they cry,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To give them leave for but a little stound,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1259" id="noteref-1259" epub:type="noteref">1259</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>To go to mill, and see their corn y-ground:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And hardily<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1260" id="noteref-1260" epub:type="noteref">1260</a> they durstë lay their neck,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The miller should not steal them half a peck</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of corn by sleight, nor them by force bereave.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1261" id="noteref-1261" epub:type="noteref">1261</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And at the last the warden give them leave:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>John hight the one, and Alein hight the other,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of one town were they born, that hightë Strother,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1262" id="noteref-1262" epub:type="noteref">1262</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Far in the North, I cannot tell you where.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This Alein he made ready all his gear,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And on a horse the sack he cast anon:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Forth went Alein the clerk, and also John,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With good sword and with buckler by their side.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>John knew the way, him needed not no guide,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And at the mill the sack adown he lay’th.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Alein spake first; “All hail, Simón, in faith,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>How fares thy fairë daughter, and thy wife?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Alein, welcome,” quoth Simkin, “by my life,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And John also: how now, what do ye here?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“By God, Simón,” quoth John, “need has no peer.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1263" id="noteref-1263" epub:type="noteref">1263</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Him serve himself behoves that has no swain,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1264" id="noteref-1264" epub:type="noteref">1264</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or else he is a fool, as clerkës sayn.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Our manciple I hope<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1265" id="noteref-1265" epub:type="noteref">1265</a> he will be dead,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So workës aye the wangës<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1266" id="noteref-1266" epub:type="noteref">1266</a> in his head:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And therefore is I come, and eke Alein,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To grind our corn and carry it home again:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I pray you speed us hence as well ye may.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“It shall be done,” quoth Simkin, “by my fay.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>What will ye do while that it is in hand?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“By God, right by the hopper will I stand,”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Quoth John, “and see how that the corn goes in.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Yet saw I never, by my father’s kin,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>How that the hopper waggës to and fro.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Alein answered, “John, and wilt thou so?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then will I be beneathë, by my crown,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And see how that the mealë falls adown</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Into the trough, that shall be my disport:<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1267" id="noteref-1267" epub:type="noteref">1267</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>For, John, in faith I may be of your sort;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I is as ill a miller as is ye.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>This miller smiled at their nicéty,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1268" id="noteref-1268" epub:type="noteref">1268</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And thought, “All this is done but for a wile.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They weenen<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1269" id="noteref-1269" epub:type="noteref">1269</a> that no man may them beguile,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But by my thrift yet shall I blear their eye,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1270" id="noteref-1270" epub:type="noteref">1270</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>For all the sleight in their philosophy.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The more quaintë knackës<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1271" id="noteref-1271" epub:type="noteref">1271</a> that they make,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The morë will I steal when that I take.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Instead of flour yet will I give them bren.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1272" id="noteref-1272" epub:type="noteref">1272</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>The greatest clerks are not the wisest men,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As whilom to the wolf thus spake the mare:<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1273" id="noteref-1273" epub:type="noteref">1273</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of all their art ne count I not a tare.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Out at the door he went full privily,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When that he saw his timë, softëly.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He looked up and down, until he found</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The clerkës’ horse, there as he stood y-bound</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Behind the mill, under a levesell:<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1274" id="noteref-1274" epub:type="noteref">1274</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And to the horse he went him fair and well,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And stripped off the bridle right anon.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And when the horse was loose, he gan to gon</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Toward the fen, where wildë marës run,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Forth, with “Wehee!” through thick and eke through thin.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This miller went again, no word he said,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But did his note,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1275" id="noteref-1275" epub:type="noteref">1275</a> and with these clerkës play’d,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1276" id="noteref-1276" epub:type="noteref">1276</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Till that their corn was fair and well y-ground.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And when the meal was sacked and y-bound,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then John went out, and found his horse away,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And gan to cry, “Harow, and well-away!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Our horse is lost: Alein, for Goddë’s bones,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Step on thy feet; come off, man, all at once:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Alas! our warden has his palfrey lorn.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1277" id="noteref-1277" epub:type="noteref">1277</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>This Alein all forgot, both meal and corn;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>All was out of his mind his husbandry:<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1278" id="noteref-1278" epub:type="noteref">1278</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>“What, which way is he gone?” he gan to cry.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The wife came leaping inward at a renne,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1279" id="noteref-1279" epub:type="noteref">1279</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>She said; “Alas! your horse went to the fen</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With wildë mares, as fast as he could go.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Unthank<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1280" id="noteref-1280" epub:type="noteref">1280</a> come on his hand that bound him so,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And his that better should have knit the rein.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Alas!” quoth John, “Alein, for Christë’s pain</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Lay down thy sword, and I shall mine also.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I is full wight,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1281" id="noteref-1281" epub:type="noteref">1281</a> God wate,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1282" id="noteref-1282" epub:type="noteref">1282</a> as is a roe.</span>

					<span>Why n’ had thou put the capel<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1284" id="noteref-1284" epub:type="noteref">1284</a> in the lathe?<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1285" id="noteref-1285" epub:type="noteref">1285</a></span>

					<span>Ill hail, Alein, by God thou is a fonne.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1286" id="noteref-1286" epub:type="noteref">1286</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>These silly clerkës have full fast y-run</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Toward the fen, both Alein and eke John;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And when the miller saw that they were gone,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He half a bushel of their flour did take,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And bade his wife go knead it in a cake.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He said; “I trow, the clerkës were afeard,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Yet can a miller make a clerkë’s beard,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1287" id="noteref-1287" epub:type="noteref">1287</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>For all his art: yea, let them go their way!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Lo where they go! yea, let the children play:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They get him not so lightly, by my crown.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>These silly clerkës runnen up and down</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With “Keep, keep; stand, stand; jossa,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1288" id="noteref-1288" epub:type="noteref">1288</a> warderere.</span>

					<br/>
					<span>But shortly, till that it was very night</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They couldë not, though they did all their might,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Their capel catch, he ran alway so fast:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Till in a ditch they caught him at the last.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Weary and wet, as beastës in the rain,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Comes silly John, and with him comes Alein.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Alas,” quoth John, “the day that I was born!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Now are we driv’n till hething<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1290" id="noteref-1290" epub:type="noteref">1290</a> and till scorn.</span>

					<span>Both the wardén, and eke our fellows all,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And namëly<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1292" id="noteref-1292" epub:type="noteref">1292</a> the miller, well-away!”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thus plained John, as he went by the way</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Toward the mill, and Bayard<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1293" id="noteref-1293" epub:type="noteref">1293</a> in his hand.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The miller sitting by the fire he fand.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1294" id="noteref-1294" epub:type="noteref">1294</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>For it was night, and forther<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1295" id="noteref-1295" epub:type="noteref">1295</a> might they not,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But for the love of God they him besought</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of herberow and easë,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1296" id="noteref-1296" epub:type="noteref">1296</a> for their penny.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1297" id="noteref-1297" epub:type="noteref">1297</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>The miller said again, “If there be any,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Such as it is, yet shall ye have your part.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Mine house is strait, but ye have learned art;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Ye can by arguments maken a place</span>

					<span>A milë broad, of twenty foot of space.</span>

					<span>Let see now if this placë may suffice,</span>

					<span>“Now, Simon,” said this John, “by Saint Cuthberd</span>

					<br/>
					<span>I have heard say, man shall take of two things,</span>

					<span>Lo here our silver ready for to spend.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>This miller to the town his daughter send</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For ale and bread, and roasted them a goose,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And bound their horse, he should no more go loose:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And them in his own chamber made a bed.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With sheetës and with chalons<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1301" id="noteref-1301" epub:type="noteref">1301</a> fair y-spread,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Not from his owen bed ten foot or twelve:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His daughter had a bed all by herselve,</span>

					<span>Right in the samë chamber by and by:<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1302" id="noteref-1302" epub:type="noteref">1302</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>It might no better be, and causë why⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>There was no roomer herberow<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1303" id="noteref-1303" epub:type="noteref">1303</a> in the place.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They suppen, and they speaken of solace,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And drinken ever strong ale at the best.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Aboutë midnight went they all to rest.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Well had this miller varnished his head;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Full pale he was, fordrunken, and nought red.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1304" id="noteref-1304" epub:type="noteref">1304</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>He yoxed,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1305" id="noteref-1305" epub:type="noteref">1305</a> and he spake thorough the nose,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As he were in the quakke,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1306" id="noteref-1306" epub:type="noteref">1306</a> or in the pose.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1307" id="noteref-1307" epub:type="noteref">1307</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>To bed he went, and with him went his wife,</span>

					<br/>
					<span>So was her jolly whistle well y-wet.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The cradle at her beddë’s feet was set,</span>

					<span>To rock, and eke to give the child to suck.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And when that drunken was all in the crock<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1309" id="noteref-1309" epub:type="noteref">1309</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>To beddë went the daughter right anon,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To beddë went Alein, and also John.</span>

					<span>This miller had so wisly<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1311" id="noteref-1311" epub:type="noteref">1311</a> bibbed ale,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That as a horse he snorted in his sleep,</span>

					<span>The wenchë routed eke for company.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Alein the clerk, that heard this melody,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He poked John, and saidë: “Sleepest thou?</span>

					<br/>
					<span>For, John,” said he, “as ever may I thrive,</span>

					<span>For, John, there is a law that sayeth thus,</span>

					<span>That in another he shall be reliev’d.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Our corn is stol’n, soothly it is no nay,</span>

					<span>And since I shall have none amendëment</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Against my loss, I will have easëment:</span>

					<span>By Goddë’s soul, it shall none, other be.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This John answér’d; “Alein, avisë thee:<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1322" id="noteref-1322" epub:type="noteref">1322</a></span>

					<span>And up he rose, and by the wench he crept.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This wenchë lay upright, and fast she slept,</span>

					<span>That it had been too latë for to cry:</span>

					<span>And, shortly for to say, they were at one.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Now play, Alein, for I will speak of John.</span>

					<span>This John lay still a furlong way or two,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1325" id="noteref-1325" epub:type="noteref">1325</a></span>

					<span>“Alas!” quoth he, “this is a wicked jape;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1327" id="noteref-1327" epub:type="noteref">1327</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Now may I say, that I is but an ape.</span>

					<span>And groped here and there, but she found none.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Alas!” quoth she, “I had almost misgone,</span>

					<br/>
					<span>And forth she went, till she the cradle fand.</span>

					<span>“Now, dearë leman,”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1338" id="noteref-1338" epub:type="noteref">1338</a> quoth she, “go, farewele:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But ere thou go, one thing I will thee tell.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When that thou wendest homeward by the mill,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Right at the entry of the door behind</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thou shalt a cake of half a bushel find,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That was y-maked of thine owen meal,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Which that I help’d my father for to steal.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And goodë leman, God thee save and keep.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And with that word she gan almost to weep.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Alein uprose and thought, “Ere the day daw</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I will go creepen in by my felláw:”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And found the cradle with his hand anon.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“By God!” thought he, “all wrong I have misgone:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>My head is totty of my swink<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1339" id="noteref-1339" epub:type="noteref">1339</a> tonight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That maketh me that I go not aright.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I wot well by the cradle I have misgo’;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Here lie the miller and his wife also.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And forth he went a twenty devil way</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Unto the bed, there as the miller lay.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He ween’d<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1340" id="noteref-1340" epub:type="noteref">1340</a> t’ have creeped by his fellow John,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And by the miller in he crept anon,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And caught him by the neck, and gan him shake,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And said; “Thou John, thou swinë’s-head, awake</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For Christë’s soul, and hear a noble game!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For by that lord that called is Saint Jame,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As I have thriës in this shortë night</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Swived the miller’s daughter bolt-upright,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>While thou hast as a coward lain aghast.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1341" id="noteref-1341" epub:type="noteref">1341</a></span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Thou falsë harlot,” quoth the miller, “hast?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Ah, falsë traitor, falsë clerk,” quoth he,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Thou shalt be dead, by Goddë’s dignity,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Who durstë be so bold to disparáge<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1342" id="noteref-1342" epub:type="noteref">1342</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>My daughter, that is come of such lineáge?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And by the throatë-ball<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1343" id="noteref-1343" epub:type="noteref">1343</a> he caught Alein,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And he him hent<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1344" id="noteref-1344" epub:type="noteref">1344</a> dispiteously<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1345" id="noteref-1345" epub:type="noteref">1345</a> again,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And on the nose he smote him with his fist;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Down ran the bloody stream upon his breast:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And in the floor with nose and mouth all broke</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They wallow, as do two pigs in a poke.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And up they go, and down again anon,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Till that the miller spurned<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1346" id="noteref-1346" epub:type="noteref">1346</a> on a stone,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And down he backward fell upon his wife,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That wistë nothing of this nicë strife:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For she was fall’n asleep a little wight<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1347" id="noteref-1347" epub:type="noteref">1347</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>With John the clerk, that waked had all night:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And with the fall out of her sleep she braid.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1348" id="noteref-1348" epub:type="noteref">1348</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Help, holy cross of Bromëholm,”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1349" id="noteref-1349" epub:type="noteref">1349</a> she said;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“<i xml:lang="la">In manus tuas!</i> Lord, to thee I call.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Awake, Simón, the fiend is on me fall;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Mine heart is broken; help; I am but dead:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>There li’th one on my womb and on mine head.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Help, Simkin, for these falsë clerks do fight”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This John start up as fast as e’er he might,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And groped by the wallës to and fro</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To find a staff; and she start up also,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And knew the estres<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1350" id="noteref-1350" epub:type="noteref">1350</a> better than this John,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And by the wall she took a staff anon:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And saw a little shimmering of a light,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For at an hole in shone the moonë bright,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And by that light she saw them both the two,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But sickerly<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1351" id="noteref-1351" epub:type="noteref">1351</a> she wist not who was who,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But as she saw a white thing in her eye.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And when she gan this whitë thing espy,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>She ween’d<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1352" id="noteref-1352" epub:type="noteref">1352</a> the clerk had wear’d a volupere;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1353" id="noteref-1353" epub:type="noteref">1353</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And with the staff she drew aye nere and nere,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1354" id="noteref-1354" epub:type="noteref">1354</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And ween’d to have hit this Alein at the full,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And smote the miller on the pilled<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1355" id="noteref-1355" epub:type="noteref">1355</a> skull,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That down he went, and cried, “Harow! I die.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>These clerkës beat him well, and let him lie,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And greithen<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1356" id="noteref-1356" epub:type="noteref">1356</a> them, and take their horse anon,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And eke their meal, and on their way they gon:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And at the mill door eke they took their cake</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of half a bushel flour, full well y-bake.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Thus is the proudë miller well y-beat,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And hath y-lost the grinding of the wheat,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And payed for the supper every deal<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1357" id="noteref-1357" epub:type="noteref">1357</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of Alein and of John, that beat him well;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His wife is swived, and his daughter als;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1358" id="noteref-1358" epub:type="noteref">1358</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Lo, such it is a miller to be false.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And therefore this proverb is said full sooth,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Him thar<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1359" id="noteref-1359" epub:type="noteref">1359</a> not winnen<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1360" id="noteref-1360" epub:type="noteref">1360</a> well that evil do’th;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A guiler shall himself beguiled be:”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And God that sitteth high in majesty</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Save all this company, both great and smale.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thus have I quit<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1361" id="noteref-1361" epub:type="noteref">1361</a> the Miller in my tale.</span>
