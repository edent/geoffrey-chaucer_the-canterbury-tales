				<p>
					<span>Our Host upon his stirrups stood anon,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And saidë; “Good men, hearken every one,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This was a thrifty<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3676" id="noteref-3676" epub:type="noteref">3676</a> talë for the nones.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Sir Parish Priest,” quoth he, “for Goddë’s bones,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Tell us a tale, as was thy forword yore:<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3677" id="noteref-3677" epub:type="noteref">3677</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>I see well that ye learned men in lore</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Can<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3678" id="noteref-3678" epub:type="noteref">3678</a> muchë good, by Goddë’s dignity.”</span>

					<span>The Parson him answér’d, “<i xml:lang="la">Ben’dicite!</i></span>
					<br/>
					<span>What ails the man, so sinfully to swear?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Our Host answér’d, “O Jankin, be ye there?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Now, good men,” quoth our Host, “hearken to me.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I smell a Lollard<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3679" id="noteref-3679" epub:type="noteref">3679</a> in the wind,” quoth he.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Abide, for Goddë’s dignë<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3680" id="noteref-3680" epub:type="noteref">3680</a> passión,</span>

					<span>This Lollard here will preachen us somewhat.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Nay, by my father’s soul, that shall he not,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Saidë the Shipman; “Here shall he not preach,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He shall no gospel glosë<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3681" id="noteref-3681" epub:type="noteref">3681</a> here nor teach.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>We all believe in the great God,” quoth he.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“He wouldë sowë some difficultý,</span>

				<p>
					<span>A Merchant whilom dwell’d at Saint Deníse,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That richë was, for which men held him wise.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A wife he had of excellent beautý,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And companiable and revellous<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3684" id="noteref-3684" epub:type="noteref">3684</a> was she,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Which is a thing that causeth more dispence</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Than worth is all the cheer and reverence</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That men them do at feastës and at dances.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Such salutatións and countenánces</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Passen, as doth the shadow on the wall;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Put woe is him that payë must for all.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The sely<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3685" id="noteref-3685" epub:type="noteref">3685</a> husband algate<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3686" id="noteref-3686" epub:type="noteref">3686</a> he must pay,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He must us<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3687" id="noteref-3687" epub:type="noteref">3687</a> clothe and he must us array</span>
					<br/>
					<span>All for his owen worship richëly:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In which array we dancë jollily.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And if that he may not, paráventure,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or ellës list not such dispence endure,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But thinketh it is wasted and y-lost,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then must another payë for our cost,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or lend us gold, and that is perilous.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>This noble merchant held a noble house;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For which he had all day so great repair,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3688" id="noteref-3688" epub:type="noteref">3688</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>For his largesse, and for his wife was fair,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That wonder is; but hearken to my tale.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Amongës all these guestës great and smale,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>There was a monk, a fair man and a bold,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I trow a thirty winter he was old,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That ever-in-one<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3689" id="noteref-3689" epub:type="noteref">3689</a> was drawing to that place.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This youngë monk, that was so fair of face,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Acquainted was so with this goodë man,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Since that their firstë knowledgë began,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That in his house as familiár was he</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As it is possible any friend to be.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And, for as muchel as this goodë man,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And eke this monk of which that I began,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Were both the two y-born in one villáge,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The monk him claimed, as for cousinage,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3690" id="noteref-3690" epub:type="noteref">3690</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And he again him said not oncë nay,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But was as glad thereof as fowl of day;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For to his heart it was a great pleasánce.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thus be they knit with etern’ alliánce,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And each of them gan other to assure</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of brotherhood while that their life may dure.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Free was Dan<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3691" id="noteref-3691" epub:type="noteref">3691</a> John, and namely<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3692" id="noteref-3692" epub:type="noteref">3692</a> of dispence,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As in that house, and full of diligence</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To do pleasánce, and also great costáge;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3693" id="noteref-3693" epub:type="noteref">3693</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>He not forgot to give the leastë page</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In all that house; but, after their degree,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He gave the lord, and sithen<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3694" id="noteref-3694" epub:type="noteref">3694</a> his meinie,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3695" id="noteref-3695" epub:type="noteref">3695</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>When that he came, some manner honest thing;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For which they were as glad of his comíng</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As fowl is fain when that the sun upriseth.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>No more of this as now, for it sufficeth.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>But so befell, this merchant on a day</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Shope<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3696" id="noteref-3696" epub:type="noteref">3696</a> him to makë ready his array</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Toward the town of Bruges for to fare,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To buyë there a portión of ware;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3697" id="noteref-3697" epub:type="noteref">3697</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>For which he hath to Paris sent anon</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A messenger, and prayed hath Dan John</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That he should come to Saint Denís, and play<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3698" id="noteref-3698" epub:type="noteref">3698</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>With him, and with his wife, a day or tway,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Ere he to Bruges went, in allë wise.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This noble monk, of which I you devise,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3699" id="noteref-3699" epub:type="noteref">3699</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Had of his abbot, as him list, licence,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>(Because he was a man of high prudence,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And eke an officer out for to ride,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To see their granges and their barnës wide);<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3700" id="noteref-3700" epub:type="noteref">3700</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And unto Saint Denis he came anon.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Who was so welcome as my lord Dan John,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Our dearë cousin, full of courtesy?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With him he brought a jub<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3701" id="noteref-3701" epub:type="noteref">3701</a> of malvesie,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3702" id="noteref-3702" epub:type="noteref">3702</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And eke another full of fine vernage,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3703" id="noteref-3703" epub:type="noteref">3703</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And volatile,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3704" id="noteref-3704" epub:type="noteref">3704</a> as aye was his uságe:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And thus I let them eat, and drink, and play,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This merchant and this monk, a day or tway.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The thirdë day the merchant up ariseth,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And on his needës sadly him adviseth;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3705" id="noteref-3705" epub:type="noteref">3705</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And up into his countour-house<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3706" id="noteref-3706" epub:type="noteref">3706</a> went he,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To reckon with himself as well may be,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of thilkë<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3707" id="noteref-3707" epub:type="noteref">3707</a> year, how that it with him stood,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And how that he dispended bad his good,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And if that he increased were or non.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His bookës and his baggës many a one</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He laid before him on his counting-board.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Full richë was his treasure and his hoard;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For which full fast his countour door he shet;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And eke he would that no man should him let<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3708" id="noteref-3708" epub:type="noteref">3708</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of his accountës, for the meanë time:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And thus he sat, till it was passed prime.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Dan John was risen in the morn also,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And in the garden walked to and fro,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And had his thingës said full courteously.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The good wife came walking full privily</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Into the garden, where he walked soft,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And him saluted, as she had done oft;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A maiden child came in her companý,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Which as her list she might govérn and gie,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3709" id="noteref-3709" epub:type="noteref">3709</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>For yet under the yardë<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3710" id="noteref-3710" epub:type="noteref">3710</a> was the maid.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“O dearë cousin mine, Dan John,” she said,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“What aileth you so rath<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3711" id="noteref-3711" epub:type="noteref">3711</a> for to arise?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Niecë,” quoth he, “it ought enough suffice</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Five hourës for to sleep upon a night;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3712" id="noteref-3712" epub:type="noteref">3712</a> it were for an old appalled<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3713" id="noteref-3713" epub:type="noteref">3713</a> wight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As be these wedded men, that lie and dare,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3714" id="noteref-3714" epub:type="noteref">3714</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>As in a formë sits a weary hare,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Allë forstraught<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3715" id="noteref-3715" epub:type="noteref">3715</a> with houndës great and smale;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But, dearë niecë, why be ye so pale?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I trowë certes that our goodë man</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Hath you so laboúred, since this night began,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That you were need to restë hastily.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And with that word he laugh’d full merrily,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And of his owen thought he wax’d all red.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This fairë wife gan for to shake her head,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And saidë thus; “Yea, God wot all,” quoth she.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Nay, cousin mine, it stands not so with me;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For by that God, that gave me soul and life,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In all the realm of France is there no wife</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That lessë lust hath to that sorry play;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For I may sing alas and well-away!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That I was born; but to no wight,” quoth she,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Dare I not tell how that it stands with me.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Wherefore I think out of this land to wend,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or ellës of myself to make an end,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So full am I of dread and eke of care.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>This monk began upon this wife to stare,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And said, “Alas! my niecë, God forbid</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That ye for any sorrow, or any dread,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Fordo<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3716" id="noteref-3716" epub:type="noteref">3716</a> yourself: but tellë me your grief,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Paráventure I may, in your mischíef,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3717" id="noteref-3717" epub:type="noteref">3717</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Counsel or help; and therefore tellë me</span>
					<br/>
					<span>All your annoy, for it shall be secré.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For on my portos<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3718" id="noteref-3718" epub:type="noteref">3718</a> here I make an oath,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That never in my life, for lief nor loth,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3719" id="noteref-3719" epub:type="noteref">3719</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Ne shall I of no counsel you bewray.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“The same again to you,” quoth she, “I say.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>By God and by this portos I you swear,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Though men me woulden all in pieces tear,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Ne shall I never, for<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3720" id="noteref-3720" epub:type="noteref">3720</a> to go to hell,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Bewray one word of thing that ye me tell,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For no cousinage, nor alliánce,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But verily for love and affiánce.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3721" id="noteref-3721" epub:type="noteref">3721</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thus be they sworn, and thereupon they kiss’d,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And each of them told other what them list.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Cousin,” quoth she, “if that I haddë space,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As I have none, and namely<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3722" id="noteref-3722" epub:type="noteref">3722</a> in this place,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then would I tell a legend of my life,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>What I have suffer’d since I was a wife</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With mine husbánd, all<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3723" id="noteref-3723" epub:type="noteref">3723</a> be he your cousín.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Nay,” quoth this monk, “by God and Saint Martín,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He is no morë cousin unto me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Than is the leaf that hangeth on the tree;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I call him so, by Saint Denis of France,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To have the morë cause of ácquaintánce</span>

					<br/>
					<span>Tell me your grief, lest that he come adown,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And hasten you, and go away anon.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“My dearë love,” quoth she, “O my Dan John,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Full lief<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3726" id="noteref-3726" epub:type="noteref">3726</a> were me this counsel for to hide,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But out it must, I may no more abide.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>My husband is to me the worstë man</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That ever was since that the world began;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But since I am a wife, it sits<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3727" id="noteref-3727" epub:type="noteref">3727</a> not me</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To tellë no wight of our privity,</span>

					<span>God shield<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3728" id="noteref-3728" epub:type="noteref">3728</a> I shouldë tell it for his grace;</span>

					<br/>
					<span>As help me God, he is nought worth at all,</span>

					<br/>
					<span>And well ye wot, that women naturally</span>

					<span>They wouldë that their husbands shouldë be</span>

				</p>
				<p>
					<span>This gentle monk answér’d in this mannére;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Now truëly, mine owen lady dear,</span>

					<span>And with that word he caught her by the flanks,</span>

					<span>And her embraced hard, and kissed her oft.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Go now your way,” quoth he, “all still and soft,</span>

					<br/>
					<span>“Now ellës God forbiddë, Sir,” quoth she;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And forth she went, as jolly as a pie,</span>

					<span>So that men mightë dine, and that anon.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Up to her husband is this wifë gone,</span>

					<br/>
					<span>This chapman took apart, and privily</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He said him thus: “Cousin, it standeth so,</span>

					<br/>
					<span>But let this thing be secret, I you pray;</span>

					<span>This noble merchant gentilly<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3756" id="noteref-3756" epub:type="noteref">3756</a> anon</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Answér’d and said, “O cousin mine, Dan John,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Now sickerly this is a small request:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>My gold is yourës, when that it you lest,</span>

					<br/>
					<span>Pay it again when it lies in your ease;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>After my might full fain would I you please.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>These hundred frankës set he forth anon,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And privily he took them to Dan John;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>No wight in all this world wist of this loan,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Saving the merchant and Dan John alone.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They drink, and speak, and roam a while, and play,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Till that Dan John rode unto his abbay.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The morrow came, and forth this merchant rideth</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To Flanders-ward, his prentice well him guideth,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Till he came unto Bruges merrily.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Now went this merchant fast and busily</span>
					<br/>
					<span>About his need, and buyed and creanced;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He neither played at the dice, nor danced;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But as a merchant, shortly for to tell,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He led his life; and there I let him dwell.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>The Sunday next<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3760" id="noteref-3760" epub:type="noteref">3760</a> the merchant was y-gone,</span>

					<br/>
					<span>With crown and beard all fresh and newly shave,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In all the house was not so little a knave,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3761" id="noteref-3761" epub:type="noteref">3761</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Nor no wight ellës that was not full fain</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For that my lord Dan John was come again.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And shortly to the point right for to gon,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The fairë wife accorded with Dan John,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That for these hundred francs he should all night</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Havë her in his armës bolt upright;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And this accord performed was in deed.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In mirth all night a busy life they lead,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Till it was day, that Dan John went his way,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And bade the meinie<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3762" id="noteref-3762" epub:type="noteref">3762</a> “Farewell; have good day.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For none of them, nor no wight in the town,</span>

					<span>As friendës do, when they be met in fere.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3769" id="noteref-3769" epub:type="noteref">3769</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Dan John him madë feast and merry cheer;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And he him told again full specially,</span>

					<br/>
					<span>And then he shouldë be in joy and rest.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Dan John answered, “Certes, I am fain<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3770" id="noteref-3770" epub:type="noteref">3770</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>That ye in health be comë home again:</span>

					<span>Of twenty thousand shields should ye not miss,</span>

					<span>For ye so kindëly the other day</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Lentë me gold, and as I can and may</span>

					<span>This merchant, which that was full ware and wise,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Creanced hath, and paid eke in París</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To certain Lombards ready in their hond</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The sum of gold, and got of them his bond,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And home he went, merry as a popinjay.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For well he knew he stood in such array</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That needës must he win in that voyáge<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3771" id="noteref-3771" epub:type="noteref">3771</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>A thousand francs, above all his costáge.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3772" id="noteref-3772" epub:type="noteref">3772</a></span>

					<br/>
					<span>For he was rich, and clearly out of debt.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When it was day, the merchant gan embrace</span>

					<span>And up he went, and maked it full tough.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“No more,” quoth she, “by God ye have enough;”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And wantonly again with him she play’d,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Till at the last this merchant to her said.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“By God,” quoth he, “I am a little wroth</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With you, my wife, although it be me loth;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And wot ye why? by God, as that I guess,</span>

					<br/>
					<span>Ye should have warned me, ere I had gone,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That he you had a hundred frankës paid</span>

					<span>By ready token; he had him evil apaid<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3776" id="noteref-3776" epub:type="noteref">3776</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>For that I to him spake of chevisance,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3777" id="noteref-3777" epub:type="noteref">3777</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>(He seemed so as by his countenance);</span>

					<span>But natheless, by God of heaven king,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I thoughtë not to ask of him no thing.</span>

					<span>I pray thee, wife, do thou no morë so.</span>

					<br/>
					<span>I might him ask a thing that he hath paid.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>This wife was not afeared nor afraid,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But boldëly she said, and that anon;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Mary! I defy that false monk Dan John,</span>

					<br/>
					<span>I will answér you shortly to the point.</span>

				</p>
				<p>
					<span>The merchant saw none other remedy;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And for to chide, it were but a follý,</span>
