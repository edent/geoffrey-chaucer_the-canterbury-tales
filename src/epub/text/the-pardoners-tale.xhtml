					<span>This was a cursed thief, a false justíce.</span>

					<span>Be cause of death to many a creatúre.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Her beauty was her death, I dare well sayn;</span>

					<span>Lordings (quoth he), in churchë when I preach,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I painë me<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3506" id="noteref-3506" epub:type="noteref">3506</a> to have an hautein<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3507" id="noteref-3507" epub:type="noteref">3507</a> speech,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And ring it out, as round as doth a bell,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For I know all by rotë that I tell.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>My theme is always one, and ever was;</span>

					<span><i xml:lang="la">Radix malorum est cupiditas</i>.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3508" id="noteref-3508" epub:type="noteref">3508</a></span>

					<span>First I pronouncë whencë that I come,</span>

					<span>And then my bullës shew I all and some;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Our liegë lordë’s seal on my patént,</span>

					<span>That shew I first, my body to warrent,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3509" id="noteref-3509" epub:type="noteref">3509</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>That no man be so hardy, priest nor clerk,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Me to disturb of Christë’s holy werk.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And after that then tell I forth my tales.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Bullës of popës, and of cardinales,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of patriarchs, and of bishóps I shew,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And in Latín I speak a wordës few,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To savour with my predicatión,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And for to stir men to devotión</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then show I forth my longë crystal stones,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Y-crammed fall of cloutës<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3510" id="noteref-3510" epub:type="noteref">3510</a> and of bones;</span>

					<span>Relics they be, as weenë they<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3511" id="noteref-3511" epub:type="noteref">3511</a> each one.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then have I in latoun<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3512" id="noteref-3512" epub:type="noteref">3512</a> a shoulder-bone</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Which that was of a holy Jewë’s sheep.</span>

					<span>If that this bone be wash’d in any well,</span>

					<span>When he hath sowen, be it wheat or oats,</span>

					<span>So that he offer pence, or ellës groats.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And, men and women, one thing warn I you;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>If any wight be in this churchë now</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That hath done sin horríble, so that he</span>

					<span>Dare not for shame of it y-shriven<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3519" id="noteref-3519" epub:type="noteref">3519</a> be;</span>

					<span>That hath y-made her husband cokëwold,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3520" id="noteref-3520" epub:type="noteref">3520</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Such folk shall have no power nor no grace</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To offer to my relics in this place.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And whoso findeth him out of such blame,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He will come up and offer in God’s name;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And I assoil him by the authority</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Which that by bull y-granted was to me.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>By this gaud<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3521" id="noteref-3521" epub:type="noteref">3521</a> have I wonnë year by year</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A hundred marks, since I was pardonére.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I standë like a clerk in my pulpit,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And when the lewëd<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3522" id="noteref-3522" epub:type="noteref">3522</a> people down is set,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I preachë so as ye have heard before,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And tellë them a hundred japës<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3523" id="noteref-3523" epub:type="noteref">3523</a> more.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then pain I me to stretchë forth my neck,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And east and west upon the people I beck,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As doth a dovë, sitting on a bern;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3524" id="noteref-3524" epub:type="noteref">3524</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>My handës and my tonguë go so yern,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3525" id="noteref-3525" epub:type="noteref">3525</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>That it is joy to see my business.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of avarice and of such cursedness<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3526" id="noteref-3526" epub:type="noteref">3526</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Is all my preaching, for to make them free</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To give their pence, and namely<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3527" id="noteref-3527" epub:type="noteref">3527</a> unto me.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For mine intent is not but for to win,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And nothing for correctión of sin.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I reckë never, when that they be buried,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Though that their soulës go a blackburied.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3528" id="noteref-3528" epub:type="noteref">3528</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>For certes many a predicatión</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Cometh oft-time of evil intentión;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3529" id="noteref-3529" epub:type="noteref">3529</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Some for pleasánce of folk, and flattery,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To be advanced by hypocrisy;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And some for vainglory, and some for hate.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For, when I dare not otherwise debate,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then will I sting him with my tonguë smart<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3530" id="noteref-3530" epub:type="noteref">3530</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>In preaching, so that he shall not astart<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3531" id="noteref-3531" epub:type="noteref">3531</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>To be defamed falsely, if that he</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Hath trespass’d<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3532" id="noteref-3532" epub:type="noteref">3532</a> to my brethren or to me.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For, though I tellë not his proper name,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Men shall well knowë that it is the same</span>
					<br/>
					<span>By signës, and by other circumstánces.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thus quite I<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3533" id="noteref-3533" epub:type="noteref">3533</a> folk that do us displeasánces:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thus spit I out my venom, under hue</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of holiness, to seem holy and true.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But, shortly mine intent I will devise,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I preach of nothing but of covetise.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Therefore my theme is yet, and ever was⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span><i xml:lang="la">Radix malorum est cupiditas</i>.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thus can I preach against the samë vice</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Which that I use, and that is avarice.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But though myself be guilty in that sin,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Yet can I maken other folk to twin<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3534" id="noteref-3534" epub:type="noteref">3534</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>From avarice, and sorë them repent.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But that is not my principal intent;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I preachë nothing but for covetise.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of this mattére it ought enough suffice.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Then tell I them examples many a one,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of oldë stories longë timë gone;</span>

					<br/>
					<span>Such thingës can they well report and hold.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>What? trowë ye, that whilës I may preach</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And winnë gold and silver for<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3536" id="noteref-3536" epub:type="noteref">3536</a> I teach,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That I will live in povert’ wilfully?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Nay, nay, I thought it never truëly.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For I will preach and beg in sundry lands;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I will not do no labour with mine hands,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Nor makë baskets for to live thereby,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Because I will not beggen idlely.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I will none of the apostles counterfeit;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3537" id="noteref-3537" epub:type="noteref">3537</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>I will have money, wool, and cheese, and wheat,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>All<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3538" id="noteref-3538" epub:type="noteref">3538</a> were it given of the poorest page,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or of the poorest widow in a villáge:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>All<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3539" id="noteref-3539" epub:type="noteref">3539</a> should her children stervë<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3540" id="noteref-3540" epub:type="noteref">3540</a> for famíne.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Nay, I will drink the liquor of the vine,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And have a jolly wench in every town.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But hearken, lordings, in conclusioún;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Your liking is, that I shall tell a tale</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Now I have drunk a draught of corny ale,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>By God, I hope I shall you tell a thing</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That shall by reason be to your likíng;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For though myself be a full vicious man,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A moral tale yet I you tellë can,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Which I am wont to preachë, for to win.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Now hold your peace, my tale I will begin.</span>
				</p>
				<hr/>
				<p>
					<span>In Flanders whilom was a company</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of youngë folkës, that hauntéd follý,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As riot, hazard, stewës, and tavérns;</span>
					<br/>

					<span>They dance and play at dice both day and night,</span>

					<span>Within the devil’s temple, in cursed wise,</span>

					<span>Their oathës be so great and so damnáble,</span>

					<br/>
					<span>The Holy Writ take I to my witnéss,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That luxury is in wine and drunkenness.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3550" id="noteref-3550" epub:type="noteref">3550</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Lo, how that drunken Lot unkindëly<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3551" id="noteref-3551" epub:type="noteref">3551</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Lay by his daughters two unwittingly,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So drunk he was he knew not what he wrought.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Heródes, who so well the stories sought,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3552" id="noteref-3552" epub:type="noteref">3552</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>When he of wine replete was at his feast,</span>

					<br/>
					<span>To slay the Baptist John full guiltëless.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Seneca saith a good word, doubtëless:</span>

					<span>He saith he can no differencë find</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Betwixt a man that is out of his mind,</span>

					<br/>
					<span>Persevereth longer than drunkenness.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>O gluttony, full of all cursedness;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>O cause first of our confusión,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Original of our damnatión,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Till Christ had bought us with his blood again!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Lookë, how dearë, shortly for to sayn,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Abought<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3557" id="noteref-3557" epub:type="noteref">3557</a> was first this cursed villainy:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Corrupt was all this world for gluttony.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Adam our father, and his wife also,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>From Paradise, to labour and to woe,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Were driven for that vice, it is no dread.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3558" id="noteref-3558" epub:type="noteref">3558</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>For while that Adam fasted, as I read,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He was in Paradise; and when that he</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Ate of the fruit defended<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3559" id="noteref-3559" epub:type="noteref">3559</a> of the tree,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Anon he was cast out to woe and pain.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>O gluttony! well ought us on thee plain.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Oh! wist a man how many maladies</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Follow of éxcess and of gluttonies,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He wouldë be the morë measuráble<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3560" id="noteref-3560" epub:type="noteref">3560</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of his dietë, sitting at his table.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Alas! the shortë throat, the tender mouth,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Maketh that east and west, and north and south,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In earth, in air, in water, men do swink<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3561" id="noteref-3561" epub:type="noteref">3561</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>To get a glutton dainty meat and drink.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of this mattére, O Paul! well canst thou treat</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Meat unto womb, and womb eke unto meat,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Shall God destroyë both, as Paulus saith.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3562" id="noteref-3562" epub:type="noteref">3562</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Alas! a foul thing is it, by my faith,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To say this word, and fouler is the deed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When man so drinketh of the white and red,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3563" id="noteref-3563" epub:type="noteref">3563</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>That of his throat he maketh his privý</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Through thilkë cursed superfluity</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The apostle saith,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3564" id="noteref-3564" epub:type="noteref">3564</a> weeping full piteously,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>There walk many, of which you told have I⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I say it now weeping with piteous voice⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That they be enemies of Christë’s crois;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3565" id="noteref-3565" epub:type="noteref">3565</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of which the end is death; womb is their God.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>O womb, O belly, stinking is thy cod,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3566" id="noteref-3566" epub:type="noteref">3566</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Full fill’d of dung and of corruptioún;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>At either end of thee foul is the soun’.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>How great laboúr and cost is thee to find!<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3567" id="noteref-3567" epub:type="noteref">3567</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>These cookës how they stamp, and strain, and grind,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And turnë substance into accident,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To fúlfil all thy likerous talent!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Out of the hardë bonës knockë they</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The marrow, for they castë naught away</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That may go through the gullet soft and swoot<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3568" id="noteref-3568" epub:type="noteref">3568</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of spicery and leaves, of bark and root,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Shall be his sauce y-maked by delight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To make him have a newer appetite.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But, certes, he that haunteth such delices</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Is dead while that he liveth in those vices.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>A lecherous thing is wine, and drunkenness</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Is full of striving and of wretchedness.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>O drunken man! disfigur’d is thy face,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3569" id="noteref-3569" epub:type="noteref">3569</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Sour is thy breath, foul art thou to embrace:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And through thy drunken nose sowneth the soun’,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As though thous saidest aye, Samsoún! Samsoún!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And yet, God wot, Samson drank never wine.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thou fallest as it were a sticked swine;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thy tongue is lost, and all thine honest cure;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3570" id="noteref-3570" epub:type="noteref">3570</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>For drunkenness is very sepultúre</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of mannë’s wit and his discretión.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In whom that drink hath dominatión,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He can no counsel keep, it is no dread.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3571" id="noteref-3571" epub:type="noteref">3571</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Now keep you from the white and from the red,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And namely<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3572" id="noteref-3572" epub:type="noteref">3572</a> from the whitë wine of Lepe,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3573" id="noteref-3573" epub:type="noteref">3573</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>That is to sell in Fish Street<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3574" id="noteref-3574" epub:type="noteref">3574</a> and in Cheap.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This wine of Spainë creepeth subtilly</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In other winës growing fastë by,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of which there riseth such fumosity,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That when a man hath drunken draughtës three,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And weeneth that he be at home in Cheap,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He is in Spain, right at the town of Lepe,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Not at the Róchelle, nor at Bourdeaux town;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And thennë will he say, Samsoún! Samsoún!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But hearken, lordings, one word, I you pray,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That all the sov’reign actës, dare I say,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of victories in the Old Testament,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Through very God that is omnipotent,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Were done in abstinence and in prayére:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Look in the Bible, and there ye may it lear.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3575" id="noteref-3575" epub:type="noteref">3575</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Look, Attila, the greatë conqueror,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Died in his sleep,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3576" id="noteref-3576" epub:type="noteref">3576</a> with shame and dishonór,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Bleeding aye at his nose in drunkenness:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A captain should aye live in soberness.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And o’er all this, advisë<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3577" id="noteref-3577" epub:type="noteref">3577</a> you right well</span>
					<br/>
					<span>What was commanded unto Lemuel;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Not Samuel, but Lemuel, say I.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Readë the Bible,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3578" id="noteref-3578" epub:type="noteref">3578</a> and find it expresslý</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of wine giving to them that have justíce.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>No more of this, for it may well suffice.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>And, now that I have spoke of gluttony,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Now will I you defendë hazardry.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3579" id="noteref-3579" epub:type="noteref">3579</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Hazárd is very mother of leasíngs,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3580" id="noteref-3580" epub:type="noteref">3580</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And of deceit, and cursed forswearíngs:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Blasphem’ of Christ, manslaughter, and waste also</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of chattel<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3581" id="noteref-3581" epub:type="noteref">3581</a> and of time; and furthermo’</span>
					<br/>
					<span>It is repreve,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3582" id="noteref-3582" epub:type="noteref">3582</a> and contrar’ of honoúr,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For to be held a common hazardoúr.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And ever the higher he is of estate,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The morë he is holden desolate.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3583" id="noteref-3583" epub:type="noteref">3583</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>If that a princë usë hazardry,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In allë governance and policy</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He is, as by commón opinión,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Y-hold the less in reputatión.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Chilon, that was a wise ambassador,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Was sent to Corinth with full great honór</span>
					<br/>
					<span>From Lacedaemon,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3584" id="noteref-3584" epub:type="noteref">3584</a> to make álliánce;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And when he came, it happen’d him, by chance,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That all the greatest that were of that land,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Y-playing attë hazard he them fand.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For which, as soon as that it mightë be,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He stole him home again to his countrý.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And saidë there, “I will not lose my name,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Nor will I take on me so great diffame,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3585" id="noteref-3585" epub:type="noteref">3585</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>You to ally unto no hazardors.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3586" id="noteref-3586" epub:type="noteref">3586</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Sendë some other wise ambassadors,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For, by my troth, me werë lever<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3587" id="noteref-3587" epub:type="noteref">3587</a> die,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Than I should you to hazardors ally.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For ye, that be so glorious in honoúrs,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Shall not ally you to no hazardoúrs,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As by my will, nor as by my treatý.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This wisë philosópher thus said he.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Look eke how to the King Demetrius</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The King of Parthes, as the book saith us,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Sent him a pair of dice of gold in scorn,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For he had used hazard therebeforn:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For which he held his glory and renown</span>
					<br/>
					<span>At no valúe or reputatioún.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Lordës may finden other manner play</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Honest enough to drive the day away.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Now will I speak of oathës false and great</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A word or two, as oldë bookës treat.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Great swearing is a thing abomináble,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And false swearing is morë reprováble.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The highë God forbade swearing at all;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Witness on Matthew:<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3588" id="noteref-3588" epub:type="noteref">3588</a> but in special</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of swearing saith the holy Jeremie,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3589" id="noteref-3589" epub:type="noteref">3589</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thou shalt swear sooth thine oathës, and not lie:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And swear in doom,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3590" id="noteref-3590" epub:type="noteref">3590</a> and eke in righteousness;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But idle swearing is a cursedness.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3591" id="noteref-3591" epub:type="noteref">3591</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Behold and see, there in the firstë table</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of highë Goddë’s hestës<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3592" id="noteref-3592" epub:type="noteref">3592</a> honouráble,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>How that the second best of him is this,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Take not my name in idle<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3593" id="noteref-3593" epub:type="noteref">3593</a> or amiss.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Lo, rather<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3594" id="noteref-3594" epub:type="noteref">3594</a> he forbiddeth such swearíng,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Than homicide, or many a cursed thing;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I say that as by order thus it standeth;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This knoweth he that his hests understandeth,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>How that the second hest of God is that.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And farthermore, I will thee tell all plat,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3595" id="noteref-3595" epub:type="noteref">3595</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>That vengeance shall not partë from his house,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That of his oathës is outrageoús.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“By Goddë’s precious heart, and by his nails,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3596" id="noteref-3596" epub:type="noteref">3596</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And by the blood of Christ, that is in Hailes,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3597" id="noteref-3597" epub:type="noteref">3597</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Seven is my chance, and thine is cinque and trey:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>By Goddë’s armës, if thou falsely play,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This dagger shall throughout thine heartë go.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This fruit comes of the bicched<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3598" id="noteref-3598" epub:type="noteref">3598</a> bonës two,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Forswearing, ire, falseness, and homicide.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Now, for the love of Christ that for us died,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Leavë your oathës, bothë great and smale.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But, Sirs, now will I ell you forth my tale.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>These riotoúrës three, of which I tell,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Long erst than<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3599" id="noteref-3599" epub:type="noteref">3599</a> primë rang of any bell,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Were set them in a tavern for to drink;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And as they sat, they heard a bellë clink</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Before a corpse, was carried to the grave.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That one of them gan callë to his knave,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3600" id="noteref-3600" epub:type="noteref">3600</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Go bet,”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3601" id="noteref-3601" epub:type="noteref">3601</a> quoth he, “and askë readily</span>
					<br/>
					<span>What corpse is this, that passeth here forth by;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And look that thou report his namë well.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Sir,” quoth the boy, “it needeth never a deal;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3602" id="noteref-3602" epub:type="noteref">3602</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>It was me told ere ye came here two hours;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He was, pardie, an old fellów of yours,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And suddenly he was y-slain tonight;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Fordrunk<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3603" id="noteref-3603" epub:type="noteref">3603</a> as he sat on his bench upright,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>There came a privy thief, men clepë Death,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That in this country all the people slay’th,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And with his spear he smote his heart in two,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And went his way withoutë wordës mo’.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He hath a thousand slain this pestilence;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And, master, ere you come in his presénce,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Me thinketh that it were full necessary</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For to beware of such an adversary;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Be ready for to meet him evermore.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thus taughtë me my dame; I say no more.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“By Saintë Mary,” said the tavernére,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“The child saith sooth, for he hath slain this year,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Hence ov’r a mile, within a great villáge,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Both man and woman, child, and hind, and page;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I trow his habitatión be there;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To be advised<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3604" id="noteref-3604" epub:type="noteref">3604</a> great wisdóm it were,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Ere<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3605" id="noteref-3605" epub:type="noteref">3605</a> that he did a man a dishonoúr.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Yea, Goddë’s armës,” quoth this riotoúr,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Is it such peril with him for to meet?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I shall him seek, by stile and eke by street.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I make a vow, by Goddë’s dignë<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3606" id="noteref-3606" epub:type="noteref">3606</a> bones.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Hearken, fellóws, we three be allë ones:<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3607" id="noteref-3607" epub:type="noteref">3607</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Let each of us hold up his hand to other,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And each of us become the other’s brother,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And we will slay this falsë traitor Death;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He shall be slain, he that so many slay’th,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>By Goddë’s dignity, ere it be night.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Together have these three their trothë plight</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To live and die each one of them for other</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As though he were his owen boren<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3608" id="noteref-3608" epub:type="noteref">3608</a> brother.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And up they start, all drunken, in this rage,</span>

					<span>“Death shall be dead, if that we may him hent.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3611" id="noteref-3611" epub:type="noteref">3611</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>When they had gone not fully half a mile,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Right as they would have trodden o’er a stile,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>An old man and a poorë with them met.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This oldë man full meekëly them gret,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3612" id="noteref-3612" epub:type="noteref">3612</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And saidë thus; “Now, lordës, God you see!”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3613" id="noteref-3613" epub:type="noteref">3613</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>The proudest of these riotoúrës three</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Answér’d again; “What? churl, with sorry grace,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Why art thou all forwrapped<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3614" id="noteref-3614" epub:type="noteref">3614</a> save thy face?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Why livest thou so long in so great age?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This oldë man gan look on his viságe,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And saidë thus; “For that I cannot find</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A man, though that I walked unto Ind,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Neither in city, nor in no villáge,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That wouldë change his youthë for mine age;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And therefore must I have mine agë still</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As longë time as it is Goddë’s will.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And Death, alas! he will not have my life.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thus walk I like a restëless caitífe,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3615" id="noteref-3615" epub:type="noteref">3615</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And on the ground, which is my mother’s gate,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I knockë with my staff, early and late,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And say to her, ‘Leve<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3616" id="noteref-3616" epub:type="noteref">3616</a> mother, let me in.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Lo, how I wanë, flesh, and blood, and skin;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Alas! when shall my bonës be at rest?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Mother, with you I wouldë change my chest,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That in my chamber longë time hath be,</span>

					<span>Yea, for an hairy clout to wrap in me.’<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3617" id="noteref-3617" epub:type="noteref">3617</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>But yet to me she will not do that grace,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For which fall pale and welked<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3618" id="noteref-3618" epub:type="noteref">3618</a> is my face.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But, Sirs, to you it is no courtesy</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To speak unto an old man villainy,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3619" id="noteref-3619" epub:type="noteref">3619</a> he trespass in word or else in deed.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In Holy Writ ye may yourselvës read;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>‘Against<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3620" id="noteref-3620" epub:type="noteref">3620</a> an old man, hoar upon his head,</span>

					<span>Ne do unto an old man no harm now,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>No morë than ye would a man did you</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In age, if that ye may so long abide.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And God be with you, whether ye go or ride.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I must go thither as I have to go.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Nay, oldë churl, by God thou shalt not so,”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Saidë this other hazardor anon;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Thou partest not so lightly, by Saint John.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thou spakest right now of that traitor Death,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That in this country all our friendës slay’th;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Have here my troth, as thou art his espy;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3622" id="noteref-3622" epub:type="noteref">3622</a></span>
					<br/>

					<br/>
					<span>By God and by the holy sacrament;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For soothly thou art one of his assent</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To slay us youngë folk, thou falsë thief.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Now, Sirs,” quoth he, “if it be you so lief<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3624" id="noteref-3624" epub:type="noteref">3624</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>To findë Death, turn up this crooked way,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For in that grove I left him, by my fay,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Under a tree, and there he will abide;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Nor for your boast he will him nothing hide.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>See ye that oak? right there ye shall him find.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>God savë you, that bought again mankind,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And you amend!” Thus said this oldë man;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And evereach of these riotoúrës ran,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Till they came to the tree, and there they found</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of florins fine, of gold y-coined round,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Well nigh a seven bushels, as them thought.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>No longer as then after Death they sought;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But each of them so glad was of the sight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For that the florins were so fair and bright,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That down they sat them by the precious hoard.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The youngest of them spake the firstë word:</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Brethren,” quoth he, “take keep what I shall say;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>My wit is great, though that I bourde<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3625" id="noteref-3625" epub:type="noteref">3625</a> and play.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This treasure hath Fortúne unto us given</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In mirth and jollity our life to liven;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And lightly as it comes, so will we spend.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Hey! Goddë’s precious dignity! who wend<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3626" id="noteref-3626" epub:type="noteref">3626</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>To-day that we should have so fair a grace?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But might this gold he carried from this place</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Home to my house, or ellës unto yours</span>
					<br/>
					<span>(For well I wot that all this gold is ours),</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then werë we in high felicitý.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But truëly by day it may not be;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Men wouldë say that we were thievës strong,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And for our owen treasure do us hong.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3627" id="noteref-3627" epub:type="noteref">3627</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>This treasure mustë carried be by night,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As wisely and as slily as it might.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Wherefore I rede,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3628" id="noteref-3628" epub:type="noteref">3628</a> that cut<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3629" id="noteref-3629" epub:type="noteref">3629</a> among us all</span>
					<br/>
					<span>We draw, and let see where the cut will fall:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And he that hath the cut, with heartë blithe</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Shall run unto the town, and that full swithe,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3630" id="noteref-3630" epub:type="noteref">3630</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And bring us bread and wine full privily:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And two of us shall keepë subtilly</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This treasure well: and if he will not tarry,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When it is night, we will this treasure carry,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>By one assent, where as us thinketh best.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then one of them the cut brought in his fist,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And bade them draw, and look where it would fall;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And it fell on the youngest of them all;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And forth toward the town he went anon.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And all so soon as that he was y-gone,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The one of them spake thus unto the other;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Thou knowest well that thou art my sworn brother,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thy profit<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3631" id="noteref-3631" epub:type="noteref">3631</a> will I tell thee right anon.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thou knowest well that our fellów is gone,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And here is gold, and that full great plentý,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That shall departed<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3632" id="noteref-3632" epub:type="noteref">3632</a> he among us three.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But natheless, if I could shape<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3633" id="noteref-3633" epub:type="noteref">3633</a> it so</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That it departed were among us two,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Had I not done a friendë’s turn to thee?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Th’ other answér’d, “I n’ot<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3634" id="noteref-3634" epub:type="noteref">3634</a> how that may be;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He knows well that the gold is with us tway.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>What shall we do? what shall we to him say?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Shall it be counsel?”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3635" id="noteref-3635" epub:type="noteref">3635</a> said the firstë shrew;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3636" id="noteref-3636" epub:type="noteref">3636</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>“And I shall tell to thee in wordës few</span>
					<br/>
					<span>What we shall do, and bring it well about.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“I grantë,” quoth the other, “out of doubt,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That by my truth I will thee not bewray.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Now,” quoth the first, “thou know’st well we be tway,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And two of us shall stronger be than one.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Look, when that he is set,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3637" id="noteref-3637" epub:type="noteref">3637</a> thou right anon</span>

					<span>Arise, as though thou wouldest with him play;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And I shall rive him through the sidës tway,</span>

					<span>While that thou strugglest with him as in game;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And with thy dagger look thou do the same.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And then shall all this gold departed be,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>My dearë friend, betwixtë thee and me:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then may we both our lustës<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3638" id="noteref-3638" epub:type="noteref">3638</a> all fulfil,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And play at dice right at our owen will.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And thus accorded<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3639" id="noteref-3639" epub:type="noteref">3639</a> be these shrewës<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3640" id="noteref-3640" epub:type="noteref">3640</a> tway</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To slay the third, as ye have heard me say.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>The youngest, which that wentë to the town,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Full oft in heart he rolled up and down</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The beauty of these florins new and bright.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“O Lord!” quoth he, “if so were that I might</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Have all this treasure to myself alone,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>There is no man that lives under the throne</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of God, that shouldë have so merry as I.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And at the last the fiend our enemy</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Put in his thought, that he should poison buy,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With which he mightë slay his fellows twy.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3641" id="noteref-3641" epub:type="noteref">3641</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>For why, the fiend found him in such livíng,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3642" id="noteref-3642" epub:type="noteref">3642</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>That he had leave to sorrow him to bring.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For this was utterly his full intent</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To slay them both, and never to repent.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And forth he went, no longer would he tarry,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Into the town to an apothecáry,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And prayed him that he him wouldë sell</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Some poison, that he might his rattës quell,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3643" id="noteref-3643" epub:type="noteref">3643</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And eke there was a polecat in his haw,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3644" id="noteref-3644" epub:type="noteref">3644</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>That, as he said, his capons had y-slaw:<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3645" id="noteref-3645" epub:type="noteref">3645</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And fain he would him wreak,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3646" id="noteref-3646" epub:type="noteref">3646</a> if that he might,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of vermin that destroyed him by night.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Th’ apothecary answer’d, “Thou shalt have</span>

					<span>A thing, as wisly<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3647" id="noteref-3647" epub:type="noteref">3647</a> God my soulë save,</span>

					<span>This poison is so strong and violent.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This cursed man hath in his hand y-hent<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3652" id="noteref-3652" epub:type="noteref">3652</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>This poison in a box, and swift he ran</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Into the nextë street, unto a man,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And borrow’d of him largë bottles three;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And in the two the poison poured he;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The third he keptë clean for his own drink,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For all the night he shope him<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3653" id="noteref-3653" epub:type="noteref">3653</a> for to swink<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3654" id="noteref-3654" epub:type="noteref">3654</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>In carrying off the gold out of that place.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And when this riotoúr, with sorry grace,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Had fill’d with wine his greatë bottles three,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To his fellóws again repaired he.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>What needeth it thereof to sermon<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3655" id="noteref-3655" epub:type="noteref">3655</a> more?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For, right as they had cast<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3656" id="noteref-3656" epub:type="noteref">3656</a> his death before,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Right so they have him slain, and that anon.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And when that this was done, thus spake the one;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Now let us sit and drink, and make us merry,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And afterward we will his body bury.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And with that word it happen’d him <i xml:lang="fr">par cas</i><a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3657" id="noteref-3657" epub:type="noteref">3657</a></span>

					<br/>
					<span>And drank, and gave his fellow drink also,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For which anon they sterved<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3658" id="noteref-3658" epub:type="noteref">3658</a> both the two.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But certes I suppose that Avicen</span>

					<span>Wrote never in no canon, nor no fen,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3659" id="noteref-3659" epub:type="noteref">3659</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>More wondrous signës of empoisoníng,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Than had these wretches two ere their endíng.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thus ended be these homicidës two,</span>

					<span>Look, what a surety is it to you all,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That I am in your fellowship y-fall,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That may assoil you bothë more and lass,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3669" id="noteref-3669" epub:type="noteref">3669</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>When that the soul shall from the body pass.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I redë<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3670" id="noteref-3670" epub:type="noteref">3670</a> that our Hostë shall begin,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For he is most enveloped in sin.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Come forth, Sir Host, and offer first anon,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And thou shalt kiss; the relics every one,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Yea, for a groat; unbuckle anon thy purse.</span>

					<span>“Nay, nay,” quoth he, “then have I Christë’s curse!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Let be,” quoth he, “it shall not be, so thé ’ch.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3671" id="noteref-3671" epub:type="noteref">3671</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thou wouldest make me kiss thine oldë breech,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And swear it were a relic of a saint,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Though it were with thy fundament depaint’.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But, by the cross which that Saint Helen fand,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3672" id="noteref-3672" epub:type="noteref">3672</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>I would I had thy coilons in mine hand,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Instead of relics, or of sanctuary.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Let cut them off, I will thee help them carry;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They shall be shrined in a hoggë’s tord.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The Pardoner answered not one word;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So wroth he was, no wordë would he say.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Now,” quoth our Host, “I will no longer play</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With thee, nor with none other angry man.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But right anon the worthy Knight began</span>
					<br/>
					<span>(When that he saw that all the people lough<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3673" id="noteref-3673" epub:type="noteref">3673</a>),</span>

					<span>“No more of this, for it is right enough.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Sir Pardoner, be merry and glad of cheer;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And ye, Sir Host, that be to me so dear,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I pray you that ye kiss the Pardoner;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And, Pardoner, I pray thee draw thee ner,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3674" id="noteref-3674" epub:type="noteref">3674</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And as we diddë, let us laugh and play.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Anon they kiss’d, and rodë forth their way.</span>
