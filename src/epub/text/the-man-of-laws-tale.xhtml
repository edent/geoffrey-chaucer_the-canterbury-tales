				<p>
					<span>Our Hostë saw well that the brightë sun</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Th’ arc of his artificial day had run</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The fourthë part, and half an hourë more;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And, though he were not deep expert in lore,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He wist it was the eight-and-twenty day</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of April, that is messenger to May;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And saw well that the shadow of every tree</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Was in its length of the same quantity</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That was the body erect that caused it;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And therefore by the shadow he took his wit,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1401" id="noteref-1401" epub:type="noteref">1401</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>That Phoebus, which that shone so clear and bright,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Degrees was five-and-forty clomb on height;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And for that day, as in that latitude,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>It was ten of the clock, he gan conclude;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And suddenly he plight<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1402" id="noteref-1402" epub:type="noteref">1402</a> his horse about.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Lordings,” quoth he, “I warn you all this rout,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1403" id="noteref-1403" epub:type="noteref">1403</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>The fourthë partie of this day is gone.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Now for the love of God and of Saint John</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Losë no time, as farforth as ye may.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Lordings, the timë wasteth night and day,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And steals from us, what privily sleepíng,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And what through negligence in our wakíng,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As doth the stream, that turneth never again,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Descending from the mountain to the plain.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Well might Senec, and many a philosópher,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Bewailë timë more than gold in coffer.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For loss of chattels may recover’d be,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But loss of timë shendeth<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1404" id="noteref-1404" epub:type="noteref">1404</a> us, quoth he.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>It will not come again, withoutë dread,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1405" id="noteref-1405" epub:type="noteref">1405</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>No morë than will Malkin’s maidenhead,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1406" id="noteref-1406" epub:type="noteref">1406</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>When she hath lost it in her wantonness.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Let us not mouldë thus in idleness.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Sir Man of Law,” quoth he, “so have ye bliss,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Tell us a tale anon, as forword is.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1407" id="noteref-1407" epub:type="noteref">1407</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Ye be submitted through your free assent</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To stand in this case at my judgëment.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Acquit you now, and holdë your behest;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1408" id="noteref-1408" epub:type="noteref">1408</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then have ye done your dévoir<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1409" id="noteref-1409" epub:type="noteref">1409</a> at the least.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Hostë,” quoth he, “<i xml:lang="fr">de par dieux jeo asente</i>;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1410" id="noteref-1410" epub:type="noteref">1410</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>To breakë forword is not mine intent.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Behest is debt, and I would hold it fain,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>All my behest; I can no better sayn.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For such law as a man gives another wight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He should himselfë usen it by right.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thus will our text: but natheless certáin</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I can right now no thrifty<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1411" id="noteref-1411" epub:type="noteref">1411</a> talë sayn,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But Chaucer (though he can but lewëdly<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1412" id="noteref-1412" epub:type="noteref">1412</a></span>

					<br/>
					<span>Hath said them, in such English as he can,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of oldë time, as knoweth many a man.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And if he have not said them, levë<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1413" id="noteref-1413" epub:type="noteref">1413</a> brother,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In one book, he hath said them in another</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For he hath told of lovers up and down,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>More than Ovidë made of mentioun<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1414" id="noteref-1414" epub:type="noteref">1414</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>In his Epistolae, that be full old.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Why should I tellë them, since they he told?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In youth he made of Ceyx and Alcyon,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1415" id="noteref-1415" epub:type="noteref">1415</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And since then he hath spoke of every one</span>
					<br/>
					<span>These noble wivës, and these lovers eke.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Whoso that will his largë volume seek</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Called the Saintës’ Legend of Cupíd:<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1416" id="noteref-1416" epub:type="noteref">1416</a></span>

					<span>There may he see the largë woundës wide</span>

					<span>Of Lucrece, and of Babylon Thisbé;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The sword of Dido for the false Enée;</span>
					<br/>

					<br/>
					<span>(Of all such cursed stories I say, Fy),</span>

					<span>Or else of Tyrius Apollonius,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>How that the cursed king Antiochus</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Bereft his daughter of her maidenhead;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That is so horrible a tale to read,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When he her threw upon the pavëment.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And therefore he, of full avisëment,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1419" id="noteref-1419" epub:type="noteref">1419</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Would never write in none of his sermons</span>

					<br/>
					<span>Nor I will none rehearse, if that I may.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But of my tale how shall I do this day?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Me were loth to be liken’d doubtëless</span>

					<span>And with that word, he with a sober cheer</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Began his tale, and said as ye shall hear.</span>

					<span>O scatheful harm, condition of povérty,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With thirst, with cold, with hunger so confounded;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To askë help thee shameth in thine heartë;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>If thou none ask, so sore art thou y-wounded,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That very need unwrappeth all thy wound hid.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Maugré thine head thou must for indigence</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or steal, or beg, or borrow thy dispence.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1425" id="noteref-1425" epub:type="noteref">1425</a></span>

					<span>For he not help’d the needful in their need.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Hearken what is the sentence of the wise:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Better to die than to have indigence.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thy selvë neighëbour<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1429" id="noteref-1429" epub:type="noteref">1429</a> will thee despise,</span>

					<span>If thou be poor, thy brother hateth thee,</span>

					<br/>
					<span>Your baggës be not fill’d with ambës ace,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1432" id="noteref-1432" epub:type="noteref">1432</a></span>

					<br/>
					<span>And talës, both of peace and of debate:<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1435" id="noteref-1435" epub:type="noteref">1435</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>I were right now of talës desolate,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1436" id="noteref-1436" epub:type="noteref">1436</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>But that a merchant, gone in many a year,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Me taught a tale, which ye shall after hear.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>In Syria whilom dwelt a company</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of chapmen rich, and thereto sad<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1437" id="noteref-1437" epub:type="noteref">1437</a> and true,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That widëwherë<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1438" id="noteref-1438" epub:type="noteref">1438</a> sent their spicery,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Clothës of gold, and satins rich of hue.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Their chaffare<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1439" id="noteref-1439" epub:type="noteref">1439</a> was so thriftly<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1440" id="noteref-1440" epub:type="noteref">1440</a> and so new,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That every wight had dainty<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1441" id="noteref-1441" epub:type="noteref">1441</a> to chaffare<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1442" id="noteref-1442" epub:type="noteref">1442</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>With them, and eke to sellë them their ware.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Now fell it, that the masters of that sort</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Have shapen them<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1443" id="noteref-1443" epub:type="noteref">1443</a> to Romë for to wend,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Were it for chapmanhood<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1444" id="noteref-1444" epub:type="noteref">1444</a> or for disport,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>None other message would they thither send,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But come themselves to Rome, this is the end:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And in such place as thought them ávantage</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For their intent, they took their herbergage.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1445" id="noteref-1445" epub:type="noteref">1445</a></span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Sojourned have these merchants in that town</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A certain time as fell to their pleasance:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And so befell, that th’ excellent renown</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of th’ emperorë’s daughter, Dame Constance,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Reported was, with every circumstance,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Unto these Syrian merchants in such wise,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>From day to day, as I shall you devise<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1446" id="noteref-1446" epub:type="noteref">1446</a></span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>This was the common voice of every man:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Our emperor of Romë, God him see,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1447" id="noteref-1447" epub:type="noteref">1447</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>A daughter hath, that since the world began,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To reckon as well her goodness and beautý,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Was never such another as is she:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I pray to God in honour her sustene,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And would she were of all Európe the queen.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“In her is highë beauty without pride,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And youth withoutë greenhood<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1448" id="noteref-1448" epub:type="noteref">1448</a> or follý:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To all her workës virtue is her guide;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Humbless hath slain in her all tyranny:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>She is the mirror of all courtesy,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Her heart a very chamber of holiness,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Her hand miníster of freedom for almess.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1449" id="noteref-1449" epub:type="noteref">1449</a></span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>And all this voice was sooth, as God is true;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But now to purpose<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1450" id="noteref-1450" epub:type="noteref">1450</a> let us turn again.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>These merchants have done freight<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1451" id="noteref-1451" epub:type="noteref">1451</a> their shippës new,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And when they have this blissful maiden seen,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Homë to Syria then they went full fain,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And did their needës,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1452" id="noteref-1452" epub:type="noteref">1452</a> as they have done yore,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1453" id="noteref-1453" epub:type="noteref">1453</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And liv’d in weal;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1454" id="noteref-1454" epub:type="noteref">1454</a> I can you say no more.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Now fell it, that these merchants stood in grace<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1455" id="noteref-1455" epub:type="noteref">1455</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of him that was the Soudan<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1456" id="noteref-1456" epub:type="noteref">1456</a> of Syrie:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For when they came from any strangë place</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He would of his benignë courtesy</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Make them good cheer, and busily espy<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1457" id="noteref-1457" epub:type="noteref">1457</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Tidings of sundry regnës,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1458" id="noteref-1458" epub:type="noteref">1458</a> for to lear<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1459" id="noteref-1459" epub:type="noteref">1459</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>The wonders that they mightë see or hear.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Amongës other thingës, speciálly</span>
					<br/>
					<span>These merchants have him told of Dame Constance’</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So great nobless, in earnest so royálly,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That this Soudan hath caught so great pleasance</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To have her figure in his remembránce,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That all his lust,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1460" id="noteref-1460" epub:type="noteref">1460</a> and all his busy cure,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1461" id="noteref-1461" epub:type="noteref">1461</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Was for to love her while his life may dure.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Paráventure in thilkë<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1462" id="noteref-1462" epub:type="noteref">1462</a> largë book,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Which that men call the heaven, y-written was</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With starrës, when that he his birthë took,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That he for love should have his death, alas!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For in the starrës, clearer than is glass,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Is written, God wot, whoso could it read,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The death of every man withoutë dread.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1463" id="noteref-1463" epub:type="noteref">1463</a></span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>In starrës many a winter therebeforn</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Was writ the death of Hector, Achilles,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of Pompey, Julius, ere they were born;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The strife of Thebes; and of Hercules,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of Samson, Turnus, and of Socrates</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The death; but mennë’s wittës be so dull,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That no wight can well read it at the full.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>This Soudan for his privy council sent,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And, shortly of this matter for to pace,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1464" id="noteref-1464" epub:type="noteref">1464</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>He hath to them declared his intent,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And told them certain, but<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1465" id="noteref-1465" epub:type="noteref">1465</a> he might have grace</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To have Constance, within a little space,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He was but dead; and charged them in hie<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1466" id="noteref-1466" epub:type="noteref">1466</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>To shapë<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1467" id="noteref-1467" epub:type="noteref">1467</a> for his life some remedy.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Diversë men diversë thingës said;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And arguments they casten up and down;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Many a subtle reason forth they laid;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They speak of magic, and abusión;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1468" id="noteref-1468" epub:type="noteref">1468</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>But finally, as in conclusión,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They cannot see in that none ávantage,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Nor in no other way, save marriáge.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Then saw they therein such difficulty</span>
					<br/>
					<span>By way of reason, for to speak all plain,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Because that there was such diversity</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Between their bothë lawës, that they sayn,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They trowë<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1469" id="noteref-1469" epub:type="noteref">1469</a> that no Christian prince would fain<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1470" id="noteref-1470" epub:type="noteref">1470</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Wedden his child under our lawë sweet,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That us was given by Mahound<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1471" id="noteref-1471" epub:type="noteref">1471</a> our prophéte.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>And he answered: “Rather than I lose</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Constance, I will be christen’d doubtëless:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I must be hers, I may none other choose,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I pray you hold your arguments in peace,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1472" id="noteref-1472" epub:type="noteref">1472</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Savë my life, and be not reckëless</span>

					<br/>
					<span>For in this woe I may not long endure.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>What needeth greater dilatation?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I say, by treaty and ambassadry,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And by the Popë’s mediation,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And all the Church, and all the chivalry,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That in destruction of Mah’metry,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1474" id="noteref-1474" epub:type="noteref">1474</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And in increase of Christë’s lawë dear,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They be accorded<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1475" id="noteref-1475" epub:type="noteref">1475</a> so as ye may hear;</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>How that the Soudan, and his baronage,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And all his lieges, shall y-christen’d be,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And he shall have Constance in marriáge,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And certain gold, I n’ot<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1476" id="noteref-1476" epub:type="noteref">1476</a> what quantity,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And hereto find they suffisant suretý.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The same accord is sworn on either side;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Now, fair Constance, Almighty God thee guide!</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Now wouldë some men waiten, as I guess,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That I should tellen all the purveyance,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1477" id="noteref-1477" epub:type="noteref">1477</a></span>

					<span>Hath shapen<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1478" id="noteref-1478" epub:type="noteref">1478</a> for his daughter, Dame Constance.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Well may men know that so great ordinance</span>
					<br/>
					<span>May no man tellen in a little clause,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As was arrayed for so high a cause.</span>

					<br/>
					<span>And notified is throughout all the town,</span>

					<span>That every wight with great devotioún</span>
					<br/>

					<span>The day is comen of her départíng⁠—</span>

					<span>That there may be no longer tarrying,</span>

					<br/>
					<span>Constance, that was with sorrow all o’ercome,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Full pale arose, and dressed her to wend,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For well she saw there was no other end.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Alas! what wonder is it though she wept,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That shall be sent to a strange natión</span>
					<br/>
					<span>From friendës, that so tenderly her kept,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And to be bound under subjectión</span>

					<br/>
					<span>Husbands be all good, and have been of yore,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1483" id="noteref-1483" epub:type="noteref">1483</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>That knowë wivës; I dare say no more.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Father,” she said, “thy wretched child Constance,</span>

				<p>
					<span>I trow at Troy when Pyrrhus brake the wall,</span>

					<span>To ship was brought this woeful fairë maid</span>

					<span>Solemnëly, with every circumstance:</span>

					<span>“Now Jesus Christ be with you all,” she said.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>There is no more, but “Farewell, fair Constance.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>She pained her<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1499" id="noteref-1499" epub:type="noteref">1499</a> to make good countenance.</span>

					<br/>
					<span>She sat her down, and said as ye shall hear.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Lordës,” she said, “ye knowen every one,</span>

				</p>
				<p>
					<span>They sworen and assented every man</span>

					<br/>
					<span>The Soudan said, “I will do at your hest,”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1518" id="noteref-1518" epub:type="noteref">1518</a></span>

				</p>
				<p>
					<span>For, shortly for to tell it at a word,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The Soudan and the Christians every one</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Were all to-hewn and sticked at the board,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1532" id="noteref-1532" epub:type="noteref">1532</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>But it were only Dame Constance alone.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This oldë Soudaness, this cursed crone,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Had with her friendës done this cursed deed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For she herself would all the country lead.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Nor there was Syrian that was converted,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That of the counsel of the Soudan wot,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1533" id="noteref-1533" epub:type="noteref">1533</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>That was not all to-hewn, ere he asterted:<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1534" id="noteref-1534" epub:type="noteref">1534</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And Constance have they ta’en anon foot-hot,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1535" id="noteref-1535" epub:type="noteref">1535</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And in a ship all steerëless,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1536" id="noteref-1536" epub:type="noteref">1536</a> God wot,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They have her set, and bid her learn to sail</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Out of Syria again-ward to Itale.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1537" id="noteref-1537" epub:type="noteref">1537</a></span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>A certain treasure that she thither lad,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1538" id="noteref-1538" epub:type="noteref">1538</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And, sooth to say, of victual great plenty,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They have her giv’n, and clothës eke she had,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And forth she sailed in the saltë sea:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>O my Constance, full of benignity,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>O emperorë’s youngë daughter dear,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He that is lord of fortune be thy steer!<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1539" id="noteref-1539" epub:type="noteref">1539</a></span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>She bless’d herself, and with full piteous voice</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Unto the cross of Christ thus saidë she;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“O dear, O wealful<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1540" id="noteref-1540" epub:type="noteref">1540</a> altar, holy cross,</span>
					<br/>

					<br/>
					<span>That wash’d the world from old iniquity,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Me from the fiend and from his clawës keep,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That day that I shall drenchen<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1541" id="noteref-1541" epub:type="noteref">1541</a> in the deep.</span>

				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Yearës and days floated this creature</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Throughout the sea of Greece, unto the strait</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of Maroc,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1544" id="noteref-1544" epub:type="noteref">1544</a> as it was her áventure:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>On many a sorry meal now may she bait,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>After her death full often may she wait,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1545" id="noteref-1545" epub:type="noteref">1545</a></span>

				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Men mighten askë, why she was not slain?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Eke at the feast who might her body save?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And I answer to that demand again,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Who saved Daniel in the horrible cave,</span>

				<p>
					<span>Now since she was not at the feast y-slaw,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1554" id="noteref-1554" epub:type="noteref">1554</a></span>

					<span>Who keptë her from drowning in the sea?</span>

					<span>Well may men know, it was no wight but he</span>

				</p>
				<p>
					<span>She drived forth into our oceán</span>

					<br/>
					<span>The will of Christ was that she should abide.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>The Constable of the castle down did fare<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1562" id="noteref-1562" epub:type="noteref">1562</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>To see this wreck, and all the ship he sought,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1563" id="noteref-1563" epub:type="noteref">1563</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And found this weary woman full of care;</span>

				</p>
				<p>
					<span>A manner Latin corrupt<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1565" id="noteref-1565" epub:type="noteref">1565</a> was her speech,</span>

					<span>But what she was she would to no man say</span>

				</p>
				<p>
					<span>She said, she was so mazed in the sea,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That she forgot her mindë, by her truth.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The Constable had of her so great pity</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And eke his wifë, that they wept for ruth:<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1570" id="noteref-1570" epub:type="noteref">1570</a></span>

					<span>She was so diligent withoutë slouth</span>

					<span>The Constable and Dame Hermegild his wife</span>

					<span>In orisons, with many a bitter tear,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Till Jesus had converted through His grace</span>

				</p>
				<p>
					<span>In all that land no Christians durstë rout;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1571" id="noteref-1571" epub:type="noteref">1571</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>All Christian folk had fled from that countrý</span>

					<span>Through Pagans, that conquered all about</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The plages<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1572" id="noteref-1572" epub:type="noteref">1572</a> of the North by land and sea.</span>

					<br/>
					<span>There was their refuge for the meanëwhile.</span>

				<p>
					<span>But yet n’ere<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1574" id="noteref-1574" epub:type="noteref">1574</a> Christian Britons so exiled,</span>

					<br/>
					<span>Honoured Christ, and heathen folk beguiled;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And nigh the castle such there dwelled three:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And one of them was blind, and might not see,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1576" id="noteref-1576" epub:type="noteref">1576</a> it were with thilk<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1577" id="noteref-1577" epub:type="noteref">1577</a> eyen of his mind,</span>

					<span>With which men mayë see when they be blind.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Bright was the sun, as in a summer’s day,</span>

					<br/>
					<span>Toward the sea, a furlong way or two,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To playen, and to roamë to and fro;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And in their walk this blindë man they met,</span>

					<span>Crooked and old, with eyen fast y-shet.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1578" id="noteref-1578" epub:type="noteref">1578</a></span>

					<span>“In the name of Christ,” criéd this blind Britón,</span>

					<br/>
					<span>This lady wax’d afrayed of that soun’,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1579" id="noteref-1579" epub:type="noteref">1579</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Lest that her husband, shortly for to sayn,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Would her for Jesus Christë’s love have slain,</span>

					<span>Till Constance made her hold, and bade her wirch<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1580" id="noteref-1580" epub:type="noteref">1580</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>The will of Christ, as daughter of holy Church.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>The Constable wax’d abashed<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1581" id="noteref-1581" epub:type="noteref">1581</a> of that sight,</span>

					<span>And saidë; “What amounteth all this fare?”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1582" id="noteref-1582" epub:type="noteref">1582</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Constance answered; “Sir, it is Christ’s might,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That helpeth folk out of the fiendë’s snare:”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And so farforth<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1583" id="noteref-1583" epub:type="noteref">1583</a> she gan our law declare,</span>

					<span>That she the Constable, ere that it were eve,</span>

					<span>Converted, and on Christ made him believe.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>This Constable was not lord of the place</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of which I speak, there as he Constance fand,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1584" id="noteref-1584" epub:type="noteref">1584</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>But kept it strongly many a winter space,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Under Allá, king of Northumberland,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That was full wise, and worthy of his hand</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Against the Scotës, as men may well hear;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But turn I will again to my mattére.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Satan, that ever us waiteth to beguile,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Saw of Constance all her perfectioún,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And cast<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1585" id="noteref-1585" epub:type="noteref">1585</a> anon how he might quite her while;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1586" id="noteref-1586" epub:type="noteref">1586</a></span>

				</p>
				<p>
					<span>He wooed her, but it availed nought;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>She wouldë do no sinnë by no way:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And for despite, he compassed his thought</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To makë her a shameful death to dey;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1589" id="noteref-1589" epub:type="noteref">1589</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>He waiteth when the Constable is away,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And privily upon a night he crept</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In Hermegilda’s chamber while she slept.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Weary, forwaked<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1590" id="noteref-1590" epub:type="noteref">1590</a> in her orisons,</span>

					<span>This knight, through Satanas’ temptatións,</span>

					<span>All softëtly is to the bed y-go,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1591" id="noteref-1591" epub:type="noteref">1591</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And cut the throat of Hermegild in two,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And laid the bloody knife by Dame Constance,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And went his way, there God give him mischance.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Soon after came the Constable home again,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And eke Allá that king was of that land,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And saw his wife dispiteously<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1592" id="noteref-1592" epub:type="noteref">1592</a> slain,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For which full oft he wept and wrung his hand;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And in the bed the bloody knife he fand</span>
					<br/>
					<span>By Dame Constance: Alas! what might she say?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For very woe her wit was all away.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>To King Allá was told all this mischance,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And eke the time, and where, and in what wise,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That in a ship was founden this Constance,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As here before ye have me heard devise:<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1593" id="noteref-1593" epub:type="noteref">1593</a></span>

				</p>
				<p>
					<span>For as the lamb toward his death is brought,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So stood this innocent before the king:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This falsë knight, that had this treason wrought,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Bore her in hand<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1596" id="noteref-1596" epub:type="noteref">1596</a> that she had done this thing:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But natheless there was great murmuring</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Among the people, that say they cannot guess</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That she had done so great a wickedness.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>For they had seen her ever virtuoús,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And loving Hermegild right as her life:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of this bare witness each one in that house,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Save he that Hermegild slew with his knife:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This gentle king had caught a great motife<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1597" id="noteref-1597" epub:type="noteref">1597</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of this witness, and thought he would inquere</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Deeper into this case, the truth to lear.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1598" id="noteref-1598" epub:type="noteref">1598</a></span>

					<span>Then is there no comparison between</span>

					<span>Thy woe, and any woe man may sustene.</span>

				<p>
					<span>“Thou saw’st thy child y-slain before thine eyen,</span>

					<span>And yet now lives my little child, parfay:<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1666" id="noteref-1666" epub:type="noteref">1666</a></span>

				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“O little child, alas! what is thy guilt,</span>

					<span>Why will thine hardë<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1671" id="noteref-1671" epub:type="noteref">1671</a> father have thee spilt?<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1672" id="noteref-1672" epub:type="noteref">1672</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>O mercy, dearë Constable,” quoth she,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“And let my little child here dwell with thee:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And if thou dar’st not save him from blame,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So kiss him onës in his father’s name.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Therewith she looked backward to the land,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And saidë, “Farewell, husband ruthëless!”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1673" id="noteref-1673" epub:type="noteref">1673</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And up she rose, and walked down the strand</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Toward the ship, her following all the press:<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1674" id="noteref-1674" epub:type="noteref">1674</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And ever she pray’d her child to hold his peace,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And took her leave, and with an holy intent</span>
					<br/>
					<span>She blessed her, and to the ship she went.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Victualed was the ship, it is no drede,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1675" id="noteref-1675" epub:type="noteref">1675</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Abundantly for her a full long space:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And other necessaries that should need<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1676" id="noteref-1676" epub:type="noteref">1676</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>She had enough, heried<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1677" id="noteref-1677" epub:type="noteref">1677</a> be Goddë’s grace:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For wind and weather, Almighty God purchase,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1678" id="noteref-1678" epub:type="noteref">1678</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And bring her home; I can no better say;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But in the sea she drived forth her way.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Allá the king came home soon after this</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Unto the castle, of the which I told,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And asked where his wife and his child is;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The Constable gan about his heart feel cold,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And plainly all the matter he him told</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As ye have heard; I can tell it no better;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And shew’d the king his seal, and eke his letter</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>And saidë; “Lord, as ye commanded me</span>
					<br/>
					<span>On pain of death, so have I done certáin.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The messenger tormented<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1679" id="noteref-1679" epub:type="noteref">1679</a> was, till he</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Mustë beknow,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1680" id="noteref-1680" epub:type="noteref">1680</a> and tell it flat and plain,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>From night to night in what place he had lain;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And thus, by wit and subtle inquiring,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Imagin’d was by whom this harm gan spring.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>The hand was known that had the letter wrote,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And all the venom of the cursed deed;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But in what wise, certáinly I know nót.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Th’ effect is this, that Alla, out of drede,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1681" id="noteref-1681" epub:type="noteref">1681</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>His mother slew, that may men plainly read,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For that she traitor was to her liegeánce:<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1682" id="noteref-1682" epub:type="noteref">1682</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thus ended oldë Donegild with mischance.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>The sorrow that this Alla night and day</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Made for his wife, and for his child also,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>There is no tonguë that it tellë may.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But now will I again to Constance go,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That floated in the sea in pain and woe</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Five year and more, as liked Christë’s sond,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1683" id="noteref-1683" epub:type="noteref">1683</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Ere that her ship approached to the lond.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1684" id="noteref-1684" epub:type="noteref">1684</a></span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Under an heathen castle, at the last,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of which the name in my text I not find,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Constance and eke her child the sea upcast.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Almighty God, that saved all mankind,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Have on Constance and on her child some mind,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That fallen is in heathen hand eftsoon<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1685" id="noteref-1685" epub:type="noteref">1685</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>In point to spill,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1686" id="noteref-1686" epub:type="noteref">1686</a> as I shall tell you soon!</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Down from the castle came there many a wight</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To gauren<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1687" id="noteref-1687" epub:type="noteref">1687</a> on this ship, and on Constance:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But shortly from the castle, on a night,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The lordë’s steward⁠—God give him mischance⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A thief that had renied our creance,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1688" id="noteref-1688" epub:type="noteref">1688</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Came to the ship alone, and said he would</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Her leman<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1689" id="noteref-1689" epub:type="noteref">1689</a> be, whether she would or n’ould.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1690" id="noteref-1690" epub:type="noteref">1690</a></span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Woe was this wretched woman then begone;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Her child cri’d, and she cried piteously:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But blissful Mary help’d her right anon,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For, with her struggling well and mightily,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The thief fell overboard all suddenly,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And in the sea he drenched<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1691" id="noteref-1691" epub:type="noteref">1691</a> for vengeánce,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And thus hath Christ unwemmed<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1692" id="noteref-1692" epub:type="noteref">1692</a> kept Constánce.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>O foul lust of luxúry! lo thine end!</span>

					<span>Not only that thou faintest<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1693" id="noteref-1693" epub:type="noteref">1693</a> mannë’s mind,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But verily thou wilt his body shend.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1694" id="noteref-1694" epub:type="noteref">1694</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Th’ end of thy work, or of thy lustës blind,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Is cómplaining: how many may men find,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That not for work, sometimes, but for th’ intent</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To do this sin, be either slain or shent?</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>How may this weakë woman have the strength</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Her to defend against this renegate?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>O Góliath, unmeasurable of length,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>How mightë David makë thee so mate?<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1695" id="noteref-1695" epub:type="noteref">1695</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>So young, and of armoúr so desolate,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1696" id="noteref-1696" epub:type="noteref">1696</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>How durst he look upon thy dreadful face?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Well may men see it was but Goddë’s grace.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Who gave Judith couráge or hardiness</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To slay him, Holofernes, in his tent,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And to deliver out of wretchedness</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The people of God? I say for this intent,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That right as God spirit of vigour sent</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To them, and saved them out of mischance,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So sent he might and vigour to Constance.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Forth went her ship throughout the narrow mouth</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of Jubaltare and Septe,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1697" id="noteref-1697" epub:type="noteref">1697</a> driving alway,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Sometimë west, and sometime north and south,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And sometime east, full many a weary day:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Till Christë’s mother (blessed be she aye)</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Had shapen<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1698" id="noteref-1698" epub:type="noteref">1698</a> through her endëless goodness</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To make an end of all her heaviness.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Now let us stint of Constance but a throw,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1699" id="noteref-1699" epub:type="noteref">1699</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And speak we of the Roman emperor,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That out of Syria had by letters know</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The slaughter of Christian folk, and dishonór</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Done to his daughter by a false traitór⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I mean the cursed wicked Soudaness,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That at the feast let<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1700" id="noteref-1700" epub:type="noteref">1700</a> slay both more and less.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>For which this emperor had sent anon</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His senator, with royal ordinance,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And other lordës, God wot, many a one,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>On Syrians to takë high vengeánce:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They burn and slay, and bring them to mischance</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Full many a day: but shortly this is th’ end,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Homeward to Rome they shaped them to wend.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>This senator repaired with victóry</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To Romë-ward, sailing full royally,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And met the ship driving, as saith the story,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In which Constancë sat full piteously:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And nothing knew he what she was, nor why</span>
					<br/>
					<span>She was in such array; nor she will say</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of her estate, although that she should dey.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1701" id="noteref-1701" epub:type="noteref">1701</a></span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>He brought her unto Rome, and to his wife</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He gave her, and her youngë son also:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And with the senator she led her life.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thus can our Lady bringen out of woe</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Woeful Constance, and many another mo’:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And longë time she dwelled in that place,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In holy works ever, as was her grace.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>The senatorë’s wife her auntë was,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But for all that she knew her ne’er the more:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I will no longer tarry in this case,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But to King Alla, whom I spake of yore,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That for his wifë wept and sighed sore,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I will return, and leave I will Constance</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Under the senatorë’s governance.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>King Alla, which that had his mother slain,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Upon a day fell in such repentánce;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That, if I shortly tell it shall and plain,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To Rome he came to receive his penitánce,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And put him in the Popë’s ordinance</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In high and low, and Jesus Christ besought</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Forgive his wicked works that he had wrought.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>The fame anon throughout the town is borne,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>How Alla king shall come on pilgrimage,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>By harbingers that wentë him beforn,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For which the senator, as was uságe,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Rode him again,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1702" id="noteref-1702" epub:type="noteref">1702</a> and many of his lineáge,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As well to show his high magnificence,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As to do any king a reverence.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Great cheerë<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1703" id="noteref-1703" epub:type="noteref">1703</a> did this noble senator</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To King Allá and he to him also;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Each of them did the other great honór;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And so befell, that in a day or two</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This senator did to King Alla go</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To feast, and shortly, if I shall not lie,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Constance’s son went in his company.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Some men would say,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1704" id="noteref-1704" epub:type="noteref">1704</a> at réquest of Constance</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This senator had led this child to feast:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I may not tellen every circumstance,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Be as be may, there was he at the least:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But sooth is this, that at his mother’s hest<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1705" id="noteref-1705" epub:type="noteref">1705</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Before Allá, during the meatë’s space,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1706" id="noteref-1706" epub:type="noteref">1706</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>The child stood, looking in the kingë’s face.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>This Alla king had of this child great wonder,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And to the senator he said anon,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Whose is that fairë child that standeth yonder?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“I n’ot,”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1707" id="noteref-1707" epub:type="noteref">1707</a> quoth he, “by God and by Saint John;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A mother he hath, but father hath he none,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That I of wot:” and shortly in a stound<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1708" id="noteref-1708" epub:type="noteref">1708</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>He told to Alla how this child was found.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“But God wot,” quoth this senator also,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“So virtuous a liver in all my life</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I never saw, as she, nor heard of mo’</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of worldly woman, maiden, widow or wife:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I dare well say she haddë lever<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1709" id="noteref-1709" epub:type="noteref">1709</a> a knife</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Throughout her breast, than be a woman wick’,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1710" id="noteref-1710" epub:type="noteref">1710</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>There is no man could bring her to that prick.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1711" id="noteref-1711" epub:type="noteref">1711</a></span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Now was this child as like unto Constance</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As possible is a creature to be:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This Alla had the face in remembránce</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of Dame Constance, and thereon mused he,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>If that the childë’s mother were aught she<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1712" id="noteref-1712" epub:type="noteref">1712</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>That was his wife; and privily he sight,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1713" id="noteref-1713" epub:type="noteref">1713</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And sped him from the table that he might.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1714" id="noteref-1714" epub:type="noteref">1714</a></span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Parfay,”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1715" id="noteref-1715" epub:type="noteref">1715</a> thought he, “phantom<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1716" id="noteref-1716" epub:type="noteref">1716</a> is in mine head.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I ought to deem, of skilful judgëment,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1717" id="noteref-1717" epub:type="noteref">1717</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>That in the saltë sea my wife is dead.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And afterward he made his argument,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“What wot I, if that Christ have hither sent</span>
					<br/>
					<span>My wife by sea, as well as he her sent</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To my country, from thennës that she went?”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>And, after noon, home with the senator</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Went Alla, for to see this wondrous chance.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This senator did Alla great honór,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And hastily he sent after Constance:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But trustë well, her listë not to dance.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When that she wistë wherefore was that sond,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1718" id="noteref-1718" epub:type="noteref">1718</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Unneth<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1719" id="noteref-1719" epub:type="noteref">1719</a> upon her feet she mightë stand.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>When Alla saw his wife, fair he her gret,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1720" id="noteref-1720" epub:type="noteref">1720</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And wept, that it was ruthë for to see,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For at the firstë look he on her set</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He knew well verily that it was she:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And she, for sorrow, as dumb stood as a tree:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So was her heartë shut in her distress,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When she remember’d his unkindëness.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Twicë she swooned in his owen sight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He wept and him excused piteously:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Now God,” quoth he, “and all his hallows<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1721" id="noteref-1721" epub:type="noteref">1721</a> bright</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So wisly<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1722" id="noteref-1722" epub:type="noteref">1722</a> on my soulë have mercý,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That of your harm as guiltëless am I,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As is Mauríce my son, so like your face,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Else may the fiend me fetch out of this place.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Long was the sobbing and the bitter pain,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Ere that their woeful heartës mightë cease;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Great was the pity for to hear them plain,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1723" id="noteref-1723" epub:type="noteref">1723</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Through whichë plaintës gan their woe increase.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I pray you all my labour to release,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I may not tell all their woe till to-morrow,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I am so weary for to speak of sorrow.</span>

				<p>
					<span>But finally, when that the sooth is wist,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1724" id="noteref-1724" epub:type="noteref">1724</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>That Alla guiltless was of all her woe,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I trow an hundred timës have they kiss’d,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And such a bliss is there betwixt them two,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That, save the joy that lasteth evermo’,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>There is none like, that any creatúre</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Hath seen, or shall see, while the world may dure.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Then prayed she her husband meekëly</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In the relief of her long piteous pine,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1725" id="noteref-1725" epub:type="noteref">1725</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>That he would pray her father specially,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That of his majesty he would incline</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To vouchësafe some day with him to dine:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>She pray’d him eke, that he should by no way</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Unto her father no word of her say.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Some men would say, how that the child Mauríce</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Did this messáge unto the emperor:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But, as I guess, Alla was not so nice,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1726" id="noteref-1726" epub:type="noteref">1726</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>To him that is so sovereign of honór</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As he that is of Christian folk the flow’r,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Send any child, but better ’tis to deem</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He went himself; and so it may well seem.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>This emperor hath granted gentilly</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To come to dinner, as he him besought:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And well rede<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1727" id="noteref-1727" epub:type="noteref">1727</a> I, he looked busily</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Upon this child, and on his daughter thought.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Alla went to his inn, and as him ought</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Arrayed<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1728" id="noteref-1728" epub:type="noteref">1728</a> for this feast in every wise,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As farforth as his cunning<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1729" id="noteref-1729" epub:type="noteref">1729</a> may suffice.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>The morrow came, and Alla gan him dress,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1730" id="noteref-1730" epub:type="noteref">1730</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And eke his wife, the emperor to meet:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And forth they rode in joy and in gladness,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And when she saw her father in the street,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>She lighted down and fell before his feet.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Father,” quoth she, “your youngë child Constance</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Is now full clean out of your rémembránce.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“I am your daughter, your Constance,” quoth she,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“That whilom ye have sent into Syrie;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>It am I, father, that in the salt sea</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Was put alone, and damned<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1731" id="noteref-1731" epub:type="noteref">1731</a> for to die.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Now, goodë father, I you mercy cry,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Send me no more into none heatheness,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But thank my lord here of his kindëness.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Who can the piteous joyë tellen all,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Betwixt them three, since they be thus y-met?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But of my talë make an end I shall,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The day goes fast, I will no longer let.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1732" id="noteref-1732" epub:type="noteref">1732</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>These gladdë folk to dinner be y-set;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In joy and bliss at meat I let them dwell,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A thousand fold well more than I can tell.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>This child Maurice was since then emperór</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Made by the Pope, and lived Christianly,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To Christë’s Churchë did he great honór:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But I let all his story passë by,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of Constance is my tale especially,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In the oldë Roman gestës<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1733" id="noteref-1733" epub:type="noteref">1733</a> men may find</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Mauríce’s life, I bear it not in mind.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>This King Alla, when he his timë sey,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1734" id="noteref-1734" epub:type="noteref">1734</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>With his Constance, his holy wife so sweet,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To England are they come the rightë way,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Where they did live in joy and in quiét.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But little while it lasted, I you hete,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1735" id="noteref-1735" epub:type="noteref">1735</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Joy of this world for time will not abide,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>From day to night it changeth as the tide.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Who liv’d ever in such delight one day,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That him not moved either conscience,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or ire, or talent, or some kind affray,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1736" id="noteref-1736" epub:type="noteref">1736</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Envy, or pride, or passion, or offence?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I say but for this endë this senténce,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1737" id="noteref-1737" epub:type="noteref">1737</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>That little while in joy or in pleasance</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Lasted the bliss of Alla with Constance.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>For death, that takes of high and low his rent,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When passed was a year, even as I guess,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Out of this world this King Alla he hent,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1738" id="noteref-1738" epub:type="noteref">1738</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>For whom Constance had full great heaviness.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Now let us pray that God his soulë bless:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And Dame Constancë, finally to say,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Toward the town of Romë went her way.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>To Rome is come this holy creature,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And findeth there her friendës whole and sound:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Now is she scaped all her áventure:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And when that she her father hath y-found,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Down on her kneës falleth she to ground,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Weeping for tenderness in heartë blithe</span>
					<br/>
					<span>She herieth<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1739" id="noteref-1739" epub:type="noteref">1739</a> God an hundred thousand sithe.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1740" id="noteref-1740" epub:type="noteref">1740</a></span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>In virtue and in holy almës-deed</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They liven all, and ne’er asunder wend;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Till death departeth them, this life they lead:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And fare now well, my tale is at an end.⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Now Jesus Christ, that of his might may send</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Joy after woe, govérn us in his grace</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And keep us allë that be in this place.</span>
