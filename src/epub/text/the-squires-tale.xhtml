					<p>
						<span>At Sarra, in the land of Tartary,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>There dwelt a king that warrayed<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3026" id="noteref-3026" epub:type="noteref">3026</a> Russie,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Through which there died many a doughty man;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>This noble king was called Cambuscan,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3027" id="noteref-3027" epub:type="noteref">3027</a></span>
						<br/>
						<span>Which in his time was of so great renown,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That there was nowhere in no regioún</span>
						<br/>
						<span>So excellent a lord in allë thing:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Him lacked nought that longeth to a king,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As of the sect of which that he was born.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He kept his law to which he was y-sworn,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And thereto<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3028" id="noteref-3028" epub:type="noteref">3028</a> he was hardy, wise, and rich,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And piteous and just, always y-lich;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3029" id="noteref-3029" epub:type="noteref">3029</a></span>
						<br/>
						<span>True of his word, benign and honouráble;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of his coráge as any centre stable;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3030" id="noteref-3030" epub:type="noteref">3030</a></span>
						<br/>
						<span>Young, fresh, and strong, in armës desiroús</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As any bachelor of all his house.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A fair persón he was, and fortunate,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And kept alway so well his royal estate,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That there was nowhere such another man.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>This noble king, this Tartar Cambuscan,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Haddë two sons by Elfeta his wife,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of which the eldest hightë Algarsife,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The other was y-callëd Camballó.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A daughter had this worthy king also,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That youngest was, and hightë Canacé:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But for to tellë you all her beautý,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>It lies not in my tongue, nor my conníng;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3031" id="noteref-3031" epub:type="noteref">3031</a></span>
						<br/>
						<span>I dare not undertake so high a thing:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Mine English eke is insufficient,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>It mustë be a rhetor<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3032" id="noteref-3032" epub:type="noteref">3032</a> excellent,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That couth his colours longing for that art,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3033" id="noteref-3033" epub:type="noteref">3033</a></span>
						<br/>
						<span>If he should her describen any part;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>I am none such, I must speak as I can.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>And so befell, that when this Cambuscan</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Had twenty winters borne his diadem,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As he was wont from year to year, I deem,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He let the feast of his nativity</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Do cryë,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3034" id="noteref-3034" epub:type="noteref">3034</a> throughout Sarra his citý,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The last Idus of March, after the year.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Phoebus the sun full jolly was and clear,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For he was nigh his exaltatión</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In Martë’s face, and in his mansión<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3035" id="noteref-3035" epub:type="noteref">3035</a></span>
						<br/>
						<span>In Aries, the choleric hot sign:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Full lusty<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3036" id="noteref-3036" epub:type="noteref">3036</a> was the weather and benign;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For which the fowls against the sunnë sheen,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3037" id="noteref-3037" epub:type="noteref">3037</a></span>
						<br/>
						<span>What for the season and the youngë green,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Full loudë sangë their affectións:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Them seemed to have got protectións</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Against the sword of winter keen and cold.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>This Cambuscan, of which I have you told,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In royal vesture, sat upon his dais,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With diadem, full high in his palace;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And held his feast so solemn and so rich,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That in this worldë was there none it lich.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3038" id="noteref-3038" epub:type="noteref">3038</a></span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of which if I should tell all the array,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Then would it occupy a summer’s day;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And eke it needeth not for to devise<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3039" id="noteref-3039" epub:type="noteref">3039</a></span>
						<br/>
						<span>At every course the order of servíce.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>I will not tellen of their strangë sewes,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3040" id="noteref-3040" epub:type="noteref">3040</a></span>
						<br/>
						<span>Nor of their swannës, nor their heronsews.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3041" id="noteref-3041" epub:type="noteref">3041</a></span>
						<br/>
						<span>Eke in that land, as tellë knightës old,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>There is some meat that is full dainty hold,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That in this land men reck of<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3042" id="noteref-3042" epub:type="noteref">3042</a> it full small:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>There is no man that may reporten all.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>I will not tarry you, for it is prime,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And for it is no fruit, but loss of time;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Unto my purpose<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3043" id="noteref-3043" epub:type="noteref">3043</a> I will have recourse.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And so befell that, after the third course,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>While that this king sat thus in his nobley,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3044" id="noteref-3044" epub:type="noteref">3044</a></span>
						<br/>
						<span>Hearing his ministrelës their thingës play</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Before him at his board deliciously,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In at the hallë door all suddenly</span>
						<br/>
						<span>There came a knight upon a steed of brass,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And in his hand a broad mirrór of glass;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Upon his thumb he had of gold a ring,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And by his side a naked sword hangíng:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And up he rode unto the highë board.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In all the hall was there not spoke a word,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For marvel of this knight; him to behold</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Full busily they waited,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3045" id="noteref-3045" epub:type="noteref">3045</a> young and old.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>This strangë knight, that came thus suddenly,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>All armed, save his head, full richëly,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Saluted king, and queen, and lordës all,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>By order as they satten in the hall,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With so high reverence and óbservánce,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As well in speech as in his countenánce,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That Gawain<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3046" id="noteref-3046" epub:type="noteref">3046</a> with his oldë courtesý,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Though he were come again out of Faerie,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Him couldë not amendë with a word.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3047" id="noteref-3047" epub:type="noteref">3047</a></span>
						<br/>
						<span>And after this, before the highë board,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He with a manly voice said his messáge,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>After the form used in his languáge,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Withoutë vice<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3048" id="noteref-3048" epub:type="noteref">3048</a> of syllable or letter.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And, for his talë shouldë seem the better,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Accordant to his wordës was his cheer,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3049" id="noteref-3049" epub:type="noteref">3049</a></span>
						<br/>
						<span>As teacheth art of speech them that it lear.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3050" id="noteref-3050" epub:type="noteref">3050</a></span>
						<br/>
						<span>Albeit that I cannot sound his style,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Nor cannot climb over so high a stile,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Yet say I this, as to commúne intent,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3051" id="noteref-3051" epub:type="noteref">3051</a></span>
						<br/>
						<span>Thus much amounteth<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3052" id="noteref-3052" epub:type="noteref">3052</a> all that ever he meant,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>If it so be that I have it in mind.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>He said; “The king of Araby and Ind,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>My liegë lord, on this solemnë day</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Saluteth you as he best can and may,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And sendeth you, in honour of your feast,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>By me, that am all ready at your hest,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3053" id="noteref-3053" epub:type="noteref">3053</a></span>
						<br/>
						<span>This steed of brass, that easily and well</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Can in the space of one day naturel</span>
						<br/>
						<span>(This is to say, in four-and-twenty hours),</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Whereso you list, in drought or else in show’rs,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Bearë your body into every place</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To which your heartë willeth for to pace,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3054" id="noteref-3054" epub:type="noteref">3054</a></span>
						<br/>
						<span>Withoutë wem<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3055" id="noteref-3055" epub:type="noteref">3055</a> of you, through foul or fair.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Or if you list to fly as high in air</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As doth an eagle, when him list to soar,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>This samë steed shall bear you evermore</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Withoutë harm, till ye be where you lest<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3056" id="noteref-3056" epub:type="noteref">3056</a></span>
						<br/>
						<span>(Though that ye sleepen on his back, or rest),</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And turn again, with writhing<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3057" id="noteref-3057" epub:type="noteref">3057</a> of a pin.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He that it wrought, he coudë<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3058" id="noteref-3058" epub:type="noteref">3058</a> many a gin;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3059" id="noteref-3059" epub:type="noteref">3059</a></span>
						<br/>
						<span>He waited<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3060" id="noteref-3060" epub:type="noteref">3060</a> in any a constellatión,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Ere he had done this operatión,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And knew full many a seal<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3061" id="noteref-3061" epub:type="noteref">3061</a> and many a bond.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>This mirror eke, that I have in mine hond,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Hath such a might, that men may in it see</span>
						<br/>
						<span>When there shall fall any adversitý</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Unto your realm, or to yourself also,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And openly who is your friend or foe.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And over all this, if any lady bright</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Hath set her heart on any manner wight,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>If he be false, she shall his treason see,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>His newë love, and all his subtlety,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>So openly that there shall nothing hide.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Wherefore, against this lusty summer-tide,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>This mirror, and this ring that ye may see,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He hath sent to my lady Canacé,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Your excellentë daughter that is here.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The virtue of this ring, if ye will hear,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Is this, that if her list it for to wear</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Upon her thumb, or in her purse it bear,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>There is no fowl that flyeth under heaven,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That she shall not well understand his steven,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3062" id="noteref-3062" epub:type="noteref">3062</a></span>
						<br/>
						<span>And know his meaning openly and plain,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And answer him in his languáge again:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And every grass that groweth upon root</span>
						<br/>
						<span>She shall eke know, to whom it will do boot,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3063" id="noteref-3063" epub:type="noteref">3063</a></span>
						<br/>
						<span>All be his woundës ne’er so deep and wide.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>This naked sword, that hangeth by my side,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Such virtue hath, that what man that it smite,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Throughout his armour it will carve and bite,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Were it as thick as is a branched oak:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And what man is y-wounded with the stroke</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Shall ne’er be whole, till that you list, of grace,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To stroke him with the flat in thilkë<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3064" id="noteref-3064" epub:type="noteref">3064</a> place</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Where he is hurt; this is as much to sayn,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Ye mustë with the flattë sword again</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Stroke him upon the wound, and it will close.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>This is the very sooth, withoutë glose;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3065" id="noteref-3065" epub:type="noteref">3065</a></span>
						<br/>
						<span>It faileth not, while it is in your hold.”</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>And when this knight had thus his talë told,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He rode out of the hall, and down he light.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>His steedë, which that shone as sunnë bright,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Stood in the court as still as any stone.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The knight is to his chamber led anon,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And is unarmed, and to meat y-set.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3066" id="noteref-3066" epub:type="noteref">3066</a></span>
						<br/>
						<span>These presents be full richëly y-fet⁠—<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3067" id="noteref-3067" epub:type="noteref">3067</a></span>
						<br/>
						<span>This is to say, the sword and the mirroúr⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And borne anon into the highë tow’r,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With certain officers ordain’d therefor;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And unto Canacé the ring is bore</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Solemnëly, where she sat at the table;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But sickerly, withouten any fable,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The horse of brass, that may not be remued.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3068" id="noteref-3068" epub:type="noteref">3068</a></span>
						<br/>
						<span>It stood as it were to the ground y-glued;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>There may no man out of the place it drive</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For no engíne of windlass or polive;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3069" id="noteref-3069" epub:type="noteref">3069</a></span>

						<br/>
						<span>And therefore in the place they have it laft,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Till that the knight hath taught them the mannére</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To voidë<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3071" id="noteref-3071" epub:type="noteref">3071</a> him, as ye shall after hear.</span>

						<span>Great was the press, that swarmed to and fro</span>

						<span>To gauren<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3072" id="noteref-3072" epub:type="noteref">3072</a> on this horse that stoodë so:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For it so high was, and so broad and long,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>So well proportioned for to be strong,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Right as it were a steed of Lombardy;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Therewith so horsely, and so quick of eye,</span>

						<span>As it a gentle Poileis<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3073" id="noteref-3073" epub:type="noteref">3073</a> courser were:</span>

						<span>It was of Faerie, as the people seem’d.</span>

						<span>As many heads, as many wittës been.</span>

						<span>Rehearsing of the oldë poetries,</span>

						<br/>
						<span>The horse that haddë wingës for to flee;</span>

						<br/>
						<span>Of angles, and of sly reflectións;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And saidë that in Rome was such a one.</span>

						<span>They speak of Alhazen and Vitellon,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3085" id="noteref-3085" epub:type="noteref">3085</a></span>
						<br/>
						<span>And Aristotle, that wrote in their lives</span>

						<br/>
						<span>And other folk have wonder’d on the swerd,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That wouldë piercë throughout every thing;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And fell in speech of Telephus the king,</span>

						<span>For he could with it bothë heal and dere,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3087" id="noteref-3087" epub:type="noteref">3087</a></span>
						<br/>
						<span>Right in such wise as men may with the swerd</span>

					<p>
						<span>At after supper went this noble king</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To see the horse of brass, with all a rout</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of lordës and of ladies him about.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Such wond’ring was there on this horse of brass,</span>

						<br/>
						<span>But finally the king asked the knight</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The virtue of this courser, and the might,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And prayed him to tell his governance.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3106" id="noteref-3106" epub:type="noteref">3106</a></span>
						<br/>
						<span>The horse anon began to trip and dance,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>When that the knight laid hand upon his rein,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And saidë, “Sir, there is no more to sayn,</span>

						<br/>
						<span>The savour passeth ever longer more,</span>

						<span>For fulsomness of the prolixitý:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And by that samë reason thinketh me</span>
						<br/>
						<span>I should unto the knottë condescend,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And maken of her walking soon an end.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Amid a tree fordry,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3139" id="noteref-3139" epub:type="noteref">3139</a> as white as chalk,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As Canacé was playing in her walk,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>There sat a falcon o’er her head full high,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That with a piteous voice so gan to cry;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That all the wood resounded of her cry,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And beat she had herself so piteouslý</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With both her wingës, till the reddë blood</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Ran endëlong<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3140" id="noteref-3140" epub:type="noteref">3140</a> the tree, there as she stood.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And ever-in-one<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3141" id="noteref-3141" epub:type="noteref">3141</a> alway she cried and shright,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3142" id="noteref-3142" epub:type="noteref">3142</a></span>
						<br/>
						<span>And with her beak herselfë she so pight,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3143" id="noteref-3143" epub:type="noteref">3143</a></span>
						<br/>
						<span>That there is no tiger, nor cruel beast,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That dwelleth either in wood or in forést;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But would have wept, if that he weepë could,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For sorrow of her, she shriek’d alway so loud.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For there was never yet no man alive,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>If that he could a falcon well descrive;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3144" id="noteref-3144" epub:type="noteref">3144</a></span>
						<br/>
						<span>That heard of such another of fairnéss</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As well of plumage, as of gentleness,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of shape, of all that mightë reckon’d be.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A falcon peregrinë seemed she,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of fremdë<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3145" id="noteref-3145" epub:type="noteref">3145</a> land; and ever as she stood</span>
						<br/>
						<span>She swooned now and now for lack of blood,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Till well-nigh is she fallen from the tree.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>This fairë kingë’s daughter Canacé,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That on her finger bare the quaintë<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3146" id="noteref-3146" epub:type="noteref">3146</a> ring,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Through which she understood well every thing</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That any fowl may in his leden<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3147" id="noteref-3147" epub:type="noteref">3147</a> sayn,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And could him answer in his leden again,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Hath understoodë what this falcon said,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And well-nigh for the ruth<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3148" id="noteref-3148" epub:type="noteref">3148</a> almost she died;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And to the tree she went, full hastily,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And on this falcon looked piteously,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And held her lap abroad, for well she wist</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The falcon mustë fallë from the twist<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3149" id="noteref-3149" epub:type="noteref">3149</a></span>
						<br/>
						<span>When that she swooned next, for lack of blood.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A longë while to waitë her she stood,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Till at the last she apake in this mannére</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Unto the hawk, as ye shall after hear.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>“What is the cause, if it be for to tell,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That ye be in this furial<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3150" id="noteref-3150" epub:type="noteref">3150</a> pain of hell?”</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Quoth Canacé unto this hawk above;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>“Is this for sorrow of death, or loss of love?</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For, as I trow,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3151" id="noteref-3151" epub:type="noteref">3151</a> these be the causes two,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That causë most a gentle heartë woe.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of other harm it needeth not to speak.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For ye yourself upon yourself awreak;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3152" id="noteref-3152" epub:type="noteref">3152</a></span>
						<br/>
						<span>Which proveth well, that either ire or dread<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3153" id="noteref-3153" epub:type="noteref">3153</a></span>
						<br/>
						<span>Must be occasion of your cruel deed,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Since that I see none other wight you chase.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For love of God, as do yourselfë grace,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3154" id="noteref-3154" epub:type="noteref">3154</a></span>
						<br/>
						<span>Or what may be your help? for, west nor east,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>I never saw ere now no bird nor beast</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That fared with himself so piteously.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Ye slay me with your sorrow verily,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>I have of you so great compassioún.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For Goddë’s love come from the tree adown;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And, as I am a kingë’s daughter true,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>If that I verily the causes knew</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of your disease,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3155" id="noteref-3155" epub:type="noteref">3155</a> if it lay in my might,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>I would amend it, ere that it were night,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>So wisly<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3156" id="noteref-3156" epub:type="noteref">3156</a> help me the great God of kind.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3157" id="noteref-3157" epub:type="noteref">3157</a></span>
						<br/>
						<span>And herbës shall I right enoughë find,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To healë with your hurtës hastily.”</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Then shriek’d this falcon yet more piteously</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Than ever she did, and fell to ground anon,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And lay aswoon, as dead as lies a stone,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Till Canacé had in her lap her take,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Unto that time she gan of swoon awake:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And, after that she out of swoon abraid,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3158" id="noteref-3158" epub:type="noteref">3158</a></span>
						<br/>
						<span>Right in her hawkë’s leden thus she said:</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>“That pity runneth soon in gentle heart</span>
						<br/>
						<span>(Feeling his simil’tude in painë’s smart),</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Is proved every day, as men may see,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As well by work as by authority;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3159" id="noteref-3159" epub:type="noteref">3159</a></span>
						<br/>
						<span>For gentle heartë kitheth<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3160" id="noteref-3160" epub:type="noteref">3160</a> gentleness.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>I see well, that ye have on my distress</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Compassión, my fairë Canacé,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of very womanly benignity</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That nature in your princples hath set.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But for no hopë for to fare the bet,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3161" id="noteref-3161" epub:type="noteref">3161</a></span>
						<br/>
						<span>But for t’ obey unto your heartë free,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And for to make others aware by me,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As by the whelp chastis’d<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3162" id="noteref-3162" epub:type="noteref">3162</a> is the lión,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Right for that cause and that conclusión,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>While that I have a leisure and a space,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Mine harm I will confessen ere I pace.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3163" id="noteref-3163" epub:type="noteref">3163</a></span>
						<br/>
						<span>And ever while the one her sorrow told,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The other wept, as she to water wo’ld,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3164" id="noteref-3164" epub:type="noteref">3164</a></span>
						<br/>
						<span>Till that the falcon bade her to be still,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And with a sigh right thus she said her till:<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3165" id="noteref-3165" epub:type="noteref">3165</a></span>
						<br/>
						<span>“Where I was bred (alas that ilkë<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3166" id="noteref-3166" epub:type="noteref">3166</a> day!)</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And foster’d in a rock of marble gray</span>
						<br/>
						<span>So tenderly, that nothing ailed me,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>I wistë not what was adversitý,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Till I could flee full high under the sky.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Then dwell’d a tercëlet<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3167" id="noteref-3167" epub:type="noteref">3167</a> me fastë by,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That seem’d a well of allë gentleness;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>All were he<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3168" id="noteref-3168" epub:type="noteref">3168</a> full of treason and falsenéss,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>It was so wrapped under humble cheer,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3169" id="noteref-3169" epub:type="noteref">3169</a></span>
						<br/>
						<span>And under hue of truth, in such mannére,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Under pleasánce, and under busy pain,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That no wight weened that he couldë feign,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>So deep in grain he dyed his coloúrs.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Right as a serpent hides him under flow’rs,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Till he may see his timë for to bite,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Right so this god of lovë’s hypocrite</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Did so his ceremonies and obeisánces,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And kept in semblance all his óbservánces,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That sounden unto<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3170" id="noteref-3170" epub:type="noteref">3170</a> gentleness of love.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As on a tomb is all the fair above,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And under is the corpse, which that ye wot,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Such was this hypocrite, both cold and hot;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And in this wise he served his intent,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That, save the fiend, none wistë what he meant:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Till he so long had weeped and complain’d,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And many a year his service to me feign’d,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Till that mine heart, too piteous and too nice,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3171" id="noteref-3171" epub:type="noteref">3171</a></span>
						<br/>
						<span>All innocent of his crowned malíce,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Forfeared of his death,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3172" id="noteref-3172" epub:type="noteref">3172</a> as thoughtë me,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Upon his oathës and his surëtý</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Granted him love, on this conditioún,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That evermore mine honour and renown</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Were saved, bothë privy and apert;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3173" id="noteref-3173" epub:type="noteref">3173</a></span>
						<br/>
						<span>This is to say, that, after his desert,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>I gave him all my heart and all my thought</span>
						<br/>
						<span>(God wot, and he, that other wayës nought<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3174" id="noteref-3174" epub:type="noteref">3174</a>),</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And took his heart in change of mine for aye.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But sooth is said, gone since many a day,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A true wight and a thiefë think not one.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3175" id="noteref-3175" epub:type="noteref">3175</a></span>
						<br/>
						<span>And when he saw the thing so far y-gone,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That I had granted him fully my love,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In such a wise as I have said above,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And given him my truë heart as free</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As he swore that he gave his heart to me,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Anon this tiger, full of doubleness,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Fell on his knees with so great humbleness,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With so high reverence, as by his cheer,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3176" id="noteref-3176" epub:type="noteref">3176</a></span>
						<br/>
						<span>So like a gentle lover in mannére,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>So ravish’d, as it seemed, for the joy,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That never Jason, nor París of Troy⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Jason? certes, nor ever other man,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Since Lamech was, that alderfirst<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3177" id="noteref-3177" epub:type="noteref">3177</a> began</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To lovë two, as writë folk beforn,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Nor ever since the firstë man was born,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Couldë no man, by twenty thousand part,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Counterfeit the sophimës<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3178" id="noteref-3178" epub:type="noteref">3178</a> of his art;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Nor worthy were t’ unbuckle his galoche,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3179" id="noteref-3179" epub:type="noteref">3179</a></span>
						<br/>
						<span>Where doubleness of feigning should approach,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Nor could so thank a wight, as he did me.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>His manner was a heaven for to see</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To any woman, were she ne’er so wise;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>So painted he and kempt,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3180" id="noteref-3180" epub:type="noteref">3180</a> at point devise,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3181" id="noteref-3181" epub:type="noteref">3181</a></span>
						<br/>
						<span>As well his wordës as his countenánce.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And I so lov’d him for his obeisánce,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And for the truth I deemed in his heart,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That, if so were that any thing him smart,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3182" id="noteref-3182" epub:type="noteref">3182</a></span>
						<br/>
						<span>All were it ne’er so lite,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3183" id="noteref-3183" epub:type="noteref">3183</a> and I it wist,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Methought I felt death at my heartë twist.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And shortly, so farforth this thing is went,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3184" id="noteref-3184" epub:type="noteref">3184</a></span>
						<br/>
						<span>That my will was his willë’s instrumént;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That is to say, my will obey’d his will</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In allë thing, as far as reason fill,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3185" id="noteref-3185" epub:type="noteref">3185</a></span>
						<br/>
						<span>Keeping the boundës of my worship ever;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And never had I thing so lefe, or lever,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3186" id="noteref-3186" epub:type="noteref">3186</a></span>
						<br/>
						<span>As him, God wot, nor never shall no mo’.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>“This lasted longer than a year or two,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That I supposed of him naught but good.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But finally, thus at the last it stood,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That fortune wouldë that he mustë twin<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3187" id="noteref-3187" epub:type="noteref">3187</a></span>
						<br/>
						<span>Out of that placë which that I was in.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Whe’er<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3188" id="noteref-3188" epub:type="noteref">3188</a> me was woe, it is no questión;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>I cannot make of it descriptión.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For one thing dare I tellë boldëly,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>I know what is the pain of death thereby;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Such harm I felt, for he might not byleve.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3189" id="noteref-3189" epub:type="noteref">3189</a></span>
						<br/>
						<span>So on a day of me he took his leave,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>So sorrowful eke, that I ween’d verily,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That he had felt as muchë harm as I,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>When that I heard him speak, and saw his hue.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But natheless, I thought he was so true,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And eke that he repairë should again</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Within a little whilë, sooth to sayn,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And reason would eke that he mustë go</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For his honoúr, as often happ’neth so,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That I made virtue of necessitý,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And took it well, since that it mustë be.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As I best might, I hid from him my sorrow,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And took him by the hand, Saint John to borrow,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3190" id="noteref-3190" epub:type="noteref">3190</a></span>
						<br/>
						<span>And said him thus; ‘Lo, I am yourës all;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Be such as I have been to you, and shall.’</span>
						<br/>
						<span>What he answér’d, it needs not to rehearse;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Who can say bet<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3191" id="noteref-3191" epub:type="noteref">3191</a> than he, who can do worse?</span>
						<br/>
						<span>When he had all well said, then had he done.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Therefore behoveth him a full long spoon,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That shall eat with a fiend; thus heard I say.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>So at the last he mustë forth his way,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And forth he flew, till he came where him lest.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>When it came him to purpose for to rest,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>I trow that he had thilkë text in mind,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That allë thing repairing to his kind</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Gladdeth himself;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3192" id="noteref-3192" epub:type="noteref">3192</a> thus say men, as I guess;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Men love of [proper] kind newfangleness,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3193" id="noteref-3193" epub:type="noteref">3193</a></span>
						<br/>
						<span>As birdës do, that men in cages feed.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For though thou night and day take of them heed,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And strew their cagë fair and soft as silk,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And give them sugar, honey, bread, and milk,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Yet, right anon as that his door is up,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3194" id="noteref-3194" epub:type="noteref">3194</a></span>
						<br/>
						<span>He with his feet will spurnë down his cup,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And to the wood he will, and wormës eat;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>So newëfangle be they of their meat,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And love novelties, of proper kind;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>No gentleness of bloodë may them bind.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>So far’d this tercëlet, alas the day!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Though he were gentle born, and fresh, and gay,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And goodly for to see, and humble, and free,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He saw upon a time a kitë flee,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And suddenly he loved this kite so,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That all his love is clean from me y-go:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And hath his trothë falsed in this wise.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Thus hath the kite my love in her servíce,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And I am lorn<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3195" id="noteref-3195" epub:type="noteref">3195</a> withoutë remedy.”</span>

					<p>
						<span>And with that word this falcon gan to cry,</span>

						<span>And swooned eft<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3196" id="noteref-3196" epub:type="noteref">3196</a> in Canacéë’s barme.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3197" id="noteref-3197" epub:type="noteref">3197</a></span>
						<br/>
						<span>Great was the sorrow, for that hawkë’s harm,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That Canacé and all her women made;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>They wist not how they might the falcon glade.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3198" id="noteref-3198" epub:type="noteref">3198</a></span>
						<br/>
						<span>But Canacé home bare her in her lap,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And softëly in plasters gan her wrap,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>There as she with her beak had hurt herselve.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Now cannot Canacé but herbës delve</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Out of the ground, and makë salvës new</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of herbës precioús and fine of hue,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To healë with this hawk; from day to night</span>
						<br/>
						<span>She did her business, and all her might.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And by her beddë’s head she made a mew,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3199" id="noteref-3199" epub:type="noteref">3199</a></span>
						<br/>
						<span>And cover’d it with velouettës blue,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3200" id="noteref-3200" epub:type="noteref">3200</a></span>
						<br/>
						<span>In sign of truth that is in woman seen;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And all without the mew is painted green,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In which were painted all these falsë fowls,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As be these tidifes,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3201" id="noteref-3201" epub:type="noteref">3201</a> tercëlets, and owls;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And piës, on them for to cry and chide,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Right for despite were painted them beside.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Thus leave I Canacé her hawk keeping.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>I will no more as now speak of her ring,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Till it come eft<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3202" id="noteref-3202" epub:type="noteref">3202</a> to purpose for to sayn</span>
						<br/>
						<span>How that this falcon got her love again</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Repentant, as the story telleth us,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>By mediatión of Camballus,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The kingë’s son of which that I you told.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But hencëforth I will my process hold</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To speak of áventures, and of battailes,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That yet was never heard so great marvailles.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>First I will tellë you of Cambuscan,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That in his timë many a city wan;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And after will I speak of Algarsife,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>How he won Theodora to his wife,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For whom full oft in great períl he was,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>N’ had he<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3203" id="noteref-3203" epub:type="noteref">3203</a> been holpen by the horse of brass.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And after will I speak of Camballó,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3204" id="noteref-3204" epub:type="noteref">3204</a></span>
						<br/>
						<span>That fought in listës with the brethren two</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For Canacé, ere that he might her win;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And where I left I will again begin.</span>
