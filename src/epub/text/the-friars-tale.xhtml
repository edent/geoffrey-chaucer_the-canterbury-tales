				<p>
					<span>This worthy limitour, this noble Frere,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He made always a manner louring cheer<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2140" id="noteref-2140" epub:type="noteref">2140</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Upon the Sompnour; but for honesty<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2141" id="noteref-2141" epub:type="noteref">2141</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>No villain word as yet to him spake he:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But at the last he said unto the Wife:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Damë,” quoth he, “God give you right good life,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Ye have here touched, all so may I thé,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2142" id="noteref-2142" epub:type="noteref">2142</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>In school matter a greatë difficulty.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Ye have said muchë thing right well, I say;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But, Damë, here as we ride by the way,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Us needeth not but for to speak of game,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And leave authorities, in Goddë’s name,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To preaching, and to school eke of clergy.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But if it like unto this company,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I will you of a Sompnour tell a game;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Pardie, ye may well knowë by the name,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That of a Sompnour may no good be said;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I pray that none of you be evil paid;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2143" id="noteref-2143" epub:type="noteref">2143</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>A Sompnour is a runner up and down</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With mandements<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2144" id="noteref-2144" epub:type="noteref">2144</a> for fornicatioún,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And is y-beat at every townë’s end.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then spake our Host; “Ah, sir, ye should be hend<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2145" id="noteref-2145" epub:type="noteref">2145</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And courteous, as a man of your estate;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In company we will have no debate:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Tell us your tale, and let the Sompnour be.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Nay,” quoth the Sompnour, “let him say by me</span>
					<br/>
					<span>What so him list; when it comes to my lot,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>By God, I shall him quiten<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2146" id="noteref-2146" epub:type="noteref">2146</a> every groat!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I shall him tellë what a great honoúr</span>
					<br/>
					<span>It is to be a flattering limitour</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And his offíce I shall him tell y-wis.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2147" id="noteref-2147" epub:type="noteref">2147</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Our Host answered, “Peace, no more of this.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And afterward he said unto the frere,</span>

					<span>“Tell forth your tale, mine owen master dear.”</span>

				<p>
					<span>Whilom<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2148" id="noteref-2148" epub:type="noteref">2148</a> there was dwelling in my countrý</span>
					<br/>
					<span>An archdeacon, a man of high degree,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That boldëly did executión,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In punishing of fornicatión,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of witchëcraft, and eke of bawdery,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of defamation, and adultery,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of churchë-reevës,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2149" id="noteref-2149" epub:type="noteref">2149</a> and of testaments,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of contracts, and of lack of sacraments,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And eke of many another manner<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2150" id="noteref-2150" epub:type="noteref">2150</a> crime,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Which needeth not rehearsen at this time,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of usury, and simony also;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But, certes, lechours did he greatest woe;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They shouldë singen, if that they were hent;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2151" id="noteref-2151" epub:type="noteref">2151</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And smallë tithers<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2152" id="noteref-2152" epub:type="noteref">2152</a> werë foul y-shent,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2153" id="noteref-2153" epub:type="noteref">2153</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>If any person would on them complain;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>There might astert them no pecunial pain.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2154" id="noteref-2154" epub:type="noteref">2154</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>For smallë tithës, and small offering,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He made the people piteously to sing;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For ere the bishop caught them with his crook,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They weren in the archëdeacon’s book;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then had he, through his jurisdictión,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Power to do on them correctión.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>He had a Sompnour ready to his hand,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A slier boy was none in Engleland;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For subtlely he had his espiaille,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2155" id="noteref-2155" epub:type="noteref">2155</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>That taught him well where it might aught avail.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He couldë spare of lechours one or two,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To teachë him to four and twenty mo’.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For⁠—though this Sompnour wood<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2156" id="noteref-2156" epub:type="noteref">2156</a> be as a hare⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To tell his harlotry I will not spare,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For we be out of their correctión,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They have of us no jurisdictión,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Ne never shall have, term of all their lives.</span>

					<span>“Peter; so be the women of the stives,”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2157" id="noteref-2157" epub:type="noteref">2157</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Quoth this Sompnour, “y-put out of our cure.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2158" id="noteref-2158" epub:type="noteref">2158</a></span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Peace, with mischance and with misáventure,”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Our Hostë said, “and let him tell his tale.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Now tellë forth, and let the Sompnour gale,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2159" id="noteref-2159" epub:type="noteref">2159</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Nor sparë not, mine owen master dear.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>This falsë thief, the Sompnour (quoth the Frere),</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Had always bawdës ready to his hand,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As any hawk to lure in Engleland,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That told him all the secrets that they knew⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For their acquaintance was not come of new;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They were his approvers<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2160" id="noteref-2160" epub:type="noteref">2160</a> privily.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He took himself at great profit thereby:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His master knew not always what he wan.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2161" id="noteref-2161" epub:type="noteref">2161</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Withoutë mandement, a lewëd<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2162" id="noteref-2162" epub:type="noteref">2162</a> man</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He could summon, on pain of Christë’s curse,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And they were inly glad to fill his purse,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And make him greatë feastës at the nale.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2163" id="noteref-2163" epub:type="noteref">2163</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And right as Judas haddë purses smale,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2164" id="noteref-2164" epub:type="noteref">2164</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And was a thief, right such a thief was he,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His master had but half his duëty.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2165" id="noteref-2165" epub:type="noteref">2165</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>He was (if I shall givë him his laud)</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A thief, and eke a Sompnour, and a bawd.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And he had wenches at his retinue,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That whether that Sir Robert or Sir Hugh,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or Jack, or Ralph, or whoso that it were</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That lay by them, they told it in his ear.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thus were the wench and he of one assent;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And he would fetch a feigned mandement,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And to the chapter summon them both two,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And pill<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2166" id="noteref-2166" epub:type="noteref">2166</a> the man, and let the wenchë go.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then would he say, “Friend, I shall for thy sake</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Do strike thee<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2167" id="noteref-2167" epub:type="noteref">2167</a> out of ourë letters blake;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2168" id="noteref-2168" epub:type="noteref">2168</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thee thar<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2169" id="noteref-2169" epub:type="noteref">2169</a> no more as in this case travail;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I am thy friend where I may thee avail.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Certain he knew of bribers many mo’</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Than possible is to tell in yearës two:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For in this world is no dog for the bow,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2170" id="noteref-2170" epub:type="noteref">2170</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>That can a hurt deer from a wholë know,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Bet<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2171" id="noteref-2171" epub:type="noteref">2171</a> than this Sompnour knew a sly lechour,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or an adult’rer, or a paramour:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And, for that was the fruit of all his rent,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Therefore on it he set all his intent.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>And so befell, that once upon a day.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This Sompnour, waiting ever on his prey,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Rode forth to summon a widow, an old ribibe,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2172" id="noteref-2172" epub:type="noteref">2172</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Feigning a cause, for he would have a bribe.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And happen’d that he saw before him ride</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A gay yeoman under a forest side:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A bow he bare, and arrows bright and keen,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He had upon a courtepy<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2173" id="noteref-2173" epub:type="noteref">2173</a> of green,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A hat upon his head with fringes blake.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Sir,” quoth this Sompnour, “hail, and well o’ertake.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Welcome,” quoth he, “and every good felláw;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Whither ridést thou under this green shaw?”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2174" id="noteref-2174" epub:type="noteref">2174</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Saidë this yeoman; “wilt thou far to-day?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This Sompnour answer’d him, and saidë, “Nay.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Here fastë by,” quoth he, “is mine intent</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To ridë, for to raisen up a rent,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That longeth to my lordë’s duety.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Ah! art thou then a bailiff?” “Yea,” quoth he.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He durstë not for very filth and shame</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Say that he was a Sompnour, for the name.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“<i xml:lang="fr">De par dieux</i>,”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2175" id="noteref-2175" epub:type="noteref">2175</a> quoth this yeoman, “levë<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2176" id="noteref-2176" epub:type="noteref">2176</a> brother,</span>

					<span>Thou art a bailiff, and I am another.</span>

					<br/>
					<span>As full of venom be those wariangles,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2181" id="noteref-2181" epub:type="noteref">2181</a></span>

					<br/>
					<span>This yeoman him answered in soft speech;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Brother,” quoth he, “far in the North countrý,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2183" id="noteref-2183" epub:type="noteref">2183</a></span>

					<span>Where as I hope some time I shall thee see.</span>

					<span>This yeoman gan a little for to smile.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Brother,” quoth he, “wilt thou that I thee tell?</span>

					<span>I am a fiend, my dwelling is in hell,</span>

					<span>In sundry shapes and not always in one?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“For we,” quoth he, “will us in such form make,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As most is able our prey for to take.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“What maketh you to have all this laboúr?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Full many a causë, levë Sir Sompnoúr,”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Saidë this fiend. “But all thing hath a time;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The day is short and it is passed prime,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And yet have I won nothing in this day;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I will intend<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2201" id="noteref-2201" epub:type="noteref">2201</a> to winning, if I may,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And not intend our thingës to declare:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For, brother mine, thy wit is all too bare</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To understand, although I told them thee.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But for<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2202" id="noteref-2202" epub:type="noteref">2202</a> thou askest why laboúrë we:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For sometimes we be Goddë’s instruments</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And meanës to do his commandëments,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When that him list, upon his creatures,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In divers acts and in divérs figúres:</span>

					<span>Withoutë him we have no might, certain,</span>

					<br/>
					<span>And sometimes, at our prayer, have we leave</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Only the body, not the soul, to grieve:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Witness on Job, whom that we did full woe,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And sometimes have we might on both the two⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This is to say, on soul and body eke,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And sometimes be we suffer’d for to seek</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Upon a man, and do his soul unrest</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And not his body, and all is for the best,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When he withstandeth our temptatión,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>It is a cause of his salvatión,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Albeit that it was not our intent</span>

					<br/>
					<span>And sometimes be we servants unto man,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As to the archbishop Saint Dunstan,</span>

					<span>And to th’ apostle servant eke was I.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Yet tell me,” quoth this Sompnour, “faithfully,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Make ye you newë bodies thus alway</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of th’ elements?” The fiend answered, “Nay:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Sometimes we feign, and sometimes we arise</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With deadë bodies, in full sundry wise,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And speak as reas’nably, and fair, and well,</span>

					<span>I do no force of<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2206" id="noteref-2206" epub:type="noteref">2206</a> your divinity.</span>

					<br/>
					<span>For I will holdë company with thee,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Till it be so that thou forsakë me.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Nay,” quoth this Sompnour, “that shall ne’er betide.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I am a yeoman, that is known full wide;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>My trothë will I hold, as in this case;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For though thou wert the devil Satanas,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>My trothë will I hold to thee, my brother,</span>

					<br/>
					<span>And if that any of us have more than other,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Let him be true, and part it with his brother.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“I grantë,” quoth the devil, “by my fay.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And with that word they rodë forth their way,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And right at th’ ent’ring of the townë’s end,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To which this Sompnour shope<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2215" id="noteref-2215" epub:type="noteref">2215</a> him for to wend,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2216" id="noteref-2216" epub:type="noteref">2216</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>They saw a cart, that charged was with hay,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Which that a carter drove forth on his way.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Deep was the way, for which the cartë stood:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The carter smote, and cried as he were wood,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2217" id="noteref-2217" epub:type="noteref">2217</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Heit Scot! heit Brok! what, spare ye for the stones?</span>

					<br/>
					<span>As farforthly<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2218" id="noteref-2218" epub:type="noteref">2218</a> as ever ye were foal’d,</span>

					<span>The devil have all, horses, and cart, and hay.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The Sompnour said, “Here shall we have a prey;”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And near the fiend he drew, as nought ne were,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2220" id="noteref-2220" epub:type="noteref">2220</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Full privily, and rowned<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2221" id="noteref-2221" epub:type="noteref">2221</a> in his ear:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Hearken, my brother, hearken, by thy faith,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Hearest thou not, how that the carter saith?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Hent<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2222" id="noteref-2222" epub:type="noteref">2222</a> it anon, for he hath giv’n it thee,</span>

					<br/>
					<span>“Nay,” quoth the devil, “God wot, never a deal,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2224" id="noteref-2224" epub:type="noteref">2224</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>It is not his intent, trust thou me well;</span>

					<br/>
					<span>Or ellës stint<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2226" id="noteref-2226" epub:type="noteref">2226</a> a while and thou shalt see.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The carter thwack’d his horses on the croup,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And they began to drawen and to stoop.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Heit now,” quoth he; “there, Jesus Christ you bless,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And all his handiwork, both more and less!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That was well twight,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2227" id="noteref-2227" epub:type="noteref">2227</a> mine owen liart,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2228" id="noteref-2228" epub:type="noteref">2228</a> boy,</span>

					<br/>
					<span>Now is my cart out of the slough, pardie.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Lo, brother,” quoth the fiend, “what told I thee?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Here may ye see, mine owen dearë brother,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The churl spake one thing, but he thought another.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Let us go forth abouten our voyáge;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Here win I nothing upon this carriáge.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>When that they came somewhat out of the town,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This Sompnour to his brother gan to rown;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Brother,” quoth he, “here wons<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2229" id="noteref-2229" epub:type="noteref">2229</a> an old rebeck,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2230" id="noteref-2230" epub:type="noteref">2230</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>That had almost as lief to lose her neck.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As for to give a penny of her good.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I will have twelvepence, though that she be wood,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2231" id="noteref-2231" epub:type="noteref">2231</a></span>

					<span>This Sompnour clapped at the widow’s gate:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Come out,” he said, “thou oldë very trate;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2232" id="noteref-2232" epub:type="noteref">2232</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>I trow thou hast some friar or priest with thee.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Who clappeth?” said this wife; “<i xml:lang="la">ben’dicite</i>,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>God save you, Sir, what is your sweetë will?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“I have,” quoth he, “of summons here a bill.</span>

					<br/>
					<span>To-morrow before our archdeacon’s knee,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To answer to the court of certain things.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Now Lord,” quoth she, “Christ Jesus, king of kings,</span>

					<span>I have been sick, and that full many a day.</span>

					<br/>
					<span>May I not ask a libel, Sir Sompnoúr,</span>

					<span>To such thing as men would apposë<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2237" id="noteref-2237" epub:type="noteref">2237</a> me?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Yes,” quoth this Sompnour, “pay anon, let see,</span>

					<span>Twelvepence to me, and I will thee acquit.</span>

					<span>My master hath the profit and not I.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Come off, and let me ridë hastily;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Give me twelvepence, I may no longer tarry.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Twelvepence!” quoth she; “now lady Saintë Mary</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So wisly<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2239" id="noteref-2239" epub:type="noteref">2239</a> help me out of care and sin,</span>

					<span>If I excuse thee, though thou should’st be spilt.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2241" id="noteref-2241" epub:type="noteref">2241</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Alas!” quoth she, “God wot, I have no guilt.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Pay me,” quoth he, “or, by the sweet Saint Anne,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As I will bear away thy newë pan</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For debtë, which thou owest me of old⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When that thou madest thine husbánd cuckóld⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I paid at home for thy correctión.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Thou liest,” quoth she, “by my salvatión;</span>

					<span>Never was I ere now, widow or wife,</span>

					<span>Summon’d unto your court in all my life;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Nor never I was but of my body true.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Unto the devil rough and black of hue</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Give I thy body and my pan also.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And when the devil heard her cursë so</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Upon her knees, he said in this mannére;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Now, Mabily, mine owen mother dear,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Is this your will in earnest that ye say?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“The devil,” quoth she, “so fetch him ere he dey,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2242" id="noteref-2242" epub:type="noteref">2242</a></span>

					<br/>
					<span>Quoth this Sompnour, “for to repentë me</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For any thing that I have had of thee;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I would I had thy smock and every cloth.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Now, brother,” quoth the devil, “be not wroth;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thy body and this pan be mine by right.</span>

					<span>Thou shalt with me to hellë yet tonight,</span>
